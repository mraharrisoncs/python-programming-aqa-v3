title: Infinite loops and beyond!
content: >
  A big issue with condition-controlled iteration is the risk of an **infinite
  loop**, a loop that never ends!


  ### Accidental infinite loops


  Remember our countdown program? This slightly altered version - which should
  count down from 10 in steps of two - contains a bug, can you spot it? Try
  running it!


  Hint: you might need to hit the stop button - the red square that looks like
  this 🟥 at the top right of the screen! 


  ```python

  def countdown():
    # count down from 10 in twos
    counter = 10
    while counter != 1:
      print(f"{counter} !")
      counter -= 2
    print("lift-off !")

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  countdown()

  ```


  `while counter != 1` says "keep looping while the counter is **not equal to
  1**", or in other words, "stop looping when the counter reaches 1".


  However, `counter` begins at 10 and counts down in twos, so it will go `8, 4,
  2, 0, -2...` ! It will never equal 1.


  We have coded an **infinite loop**. Can you work out how to fix it? Answer the
  question below.


  ### While True


  Sometimes the simplest way to code a while loop is to make it loop "forever",
  and **break out** of the loop when something happens. 


  We can code any **Boolean expression** that evaluates to `True` on our while
  loop condition, to make it loop forever. Here are some examples:


  ```python

  while counter == counter:

  while 1 == 1:

  while 1 < 2:

  while "x" = "x"

  ```


  All of these expressions evaluate to `True` at all times, and the while loop
  will run forever. But there is a much simpler expression that is always `True`
  - the keyword `True` itself!


  ```python

  while True:
    # this code block will run forever
  ```


  ### Breaking out of a loop


  There are two ways we can break out of a while loop, and we must use one of
  them inside a `while True` loop, or it will never end! First we can
  **return** out of the function that the while loop is part of. This works
  fine, if the function does not need to do anything else.&#x20;


  Here is a validation example from Lesson 3, showing this technique.


  ```python

  def get_score():
    score = int(input("Enter a score between 1 and 100: "))
    while True:
        if score < 1 or score > 100:
            print("Invalid input. Please try again.")
            score = int(input("Enter a score between 1 and 100: "))
        else:
            return score
  ```
