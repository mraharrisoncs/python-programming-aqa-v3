title: Solutions to Python practical while problems
content: >+
  Here are suggested solutions for the practical activities on the previous
  page. You can run and test the solutions in the attached files.


  ## Question 1


  ```python

  '''

  Print a countdown from the given number down to 1,

  then print 'Lift off!'.

  '''

  def countdown(start):
      while start > 0:
          print(start)
          start -= 1
      print("Lift off!")

  # main program

  countdown(5)

  countdown(10)

  ```


  Question 2


  ```python

  '''

  Repeatedly ask the user for their age until they enter

  a valid value between 0 and 120. Then print 'Age accepted'.

  '''

  def get_valid_age():
      age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
      while age < 0 or age > 120:
          age = int(input("Invalid age. Enter your age: "))
      print("Age accepted")

  # main program

  get_valid_age()

  ```


  Question 3


  ```python

  '''

  Write a function 'get_price' that returns the price of an item:

  "cola" → 2.00, "crisps" → 1.20, "water" → 1.00

  Then write the 'run_machine' function that repeatedly

  inputs items and calls 'get_price' to get the price of the item

  until the user types 'quit', and then outputs the total cost.

  '''

  def get_price(item):
      if item == "cola":
          return 2.00
      elif item == "crisps":
          return 1.20
      elif item == "water":
          return 1.00
      else:
          return 0

  def run_machine():
      total = 0
      item = input("Enter an item (or 'quit' to finish): ")

      while item != "quit":
          total += get_price(item)
          item = input("Enter an item (or 'quit' to finish): ")

      print(f"Total: £{total:.2f}")

  # main program

  run_machine()

  ```
