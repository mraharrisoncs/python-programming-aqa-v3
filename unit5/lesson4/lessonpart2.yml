title: Pseudocode WHILE ENDWHILE and REPEAT UNTIL
content: >
  ## Pre-conditioned loops in pseudocode 


  As we have seen previously, AQA exam papers and reference material use
  pseudocode rather than Python.&#x20;


  When you see `while` loops in AQA exam papers we will use keywords `WHILE` and
  `ENDWHILE `like this:


  ```python

  WHILE BoolExp
    # statements here
  ENDWHILE

  ```


  for example, our old password length validation loop looks like this:


  ```python

  password ← ""

  WHILE LEN(password) < 10
      password ← USERINPUT
  ENDWHILE

  ```


  A `while` loop always tests the condition **at the start** of each iteration.
  So in the above example, the password length is checked on entry to the loop,
  and again on every iteration.&#x20;


  This is called a **pre-conditioned** loop. Some programming languages - but
  not Python - allow you to check the loop condition **at the end** of the loop.
  This is called a **post-conditioned** loop. 


  ## Post-conditioned loops - REPEAT UNTIL


  These loops are often better suited to a problem than pre-conditioned loops.
  AQA pseudocode keywords `REPEAT` and `UNTIL` can be used to create a
  post-conditioned loop. Here is the password checker loop using these keywords:


  ```python

  REPEAT
      password ← USERINPUT
  UNTIL LEN(password) >= 10

  ```


  This code is simpler and more elegant than the original WHILE version: we
  don't need to initialise the `password` variable before we enter the loop, and
  the logic feels more natural: "repeatedly input a password until it's length
  is at least 10".


  We can't do this in Python, but here is a sample of **Lua** - a
  beginner-friendly language used in game development such as in Defold and
  Roblox - that implements this post-conditioned loop:


  ```

  # Lua code 

  repeat
      password = io.read()
  until #password >= 10

  ```


  ## "Faking" post-conditioned loops in Python


  We don't have native `REPEAT-UNTIL` in Python but we can "fake it" with
  `while`. Here is our password checker loop using only while:


  ```python

  password = ""

  while len(password) < 10:
      password = input("Enter a password: ")

  ```


  Here is another example of a `REPEAT-UNTIL` in Pseudocde, this program
  repeatedly sums coin values until a price is reached:


  ```python

  price = 150

  total = 0

  REPEAT
      coin ← USERINPUT
      total ← total + coin
  UNTIL total >= price

  ```


  Here is how we can implement that in Python without `REPEAT-UNTIL`, by using a
  Boolean variable to control the loop, and changing the `UNTIL` to an
  `if` statement:


  ```python

  # Python 'fake' post-conditioned loop

  price = 150

  total = 0

  looping = True

  while looping:
      coin = int(input())
      total = total + coin
      if total >= price:
          looping = False 
  # rest of program

  ```
