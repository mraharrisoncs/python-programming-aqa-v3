title: "Python practical: while loops"
content: >+
  ### 1. Countdown timer


  Starting with the code in **q1.py**, complete the function that accepts an
  integer representing a **starting number** and prints a countdown to zero.


  Use a `while` loop to implement the following behaviour:


  * Keep printing the current number


  * Subtract `1` each time


  * Stop when the number reaches `0`


  * After the loop finishes, print `"Lift off!"`


  For example, if the input is `3`, the output should be:


  ```

  3

  2

  1

  Lift off!

  ```

  ### 2. Input validation: age checker


  Starting with the code in **q2.py**, write a function that repeatedly asks the
  user for their **age** until they enter a valid value.


  Use a `while` loop to enforce these rules:


  * Keep asking for input while the age is **less than 0** or **greater than
  120**


  * When a valid age is finally entered, print `"Age accepted"`


  * You do not need to return anything — just validate and print


  For example, if the user enters `-5`, then `200`, then `34`, the program
  should only accept the final value.

  ### 3. Vending machine program


  Starting with the code in **q3.py**, complete a small vending‑machine program
  using **two functions** and a `while` loop.


  Write the following:


  #### **Function 1:** **`get_price(item)`**


  Accepts a string representing an item name and returns its price:


  * `"cola"` → `2.00`


  * `"crisps"` → `1.20`


  * `"water"` → `1.00`


  * For any other item, return `0`


  #### **Function 2:** **`run_machine()`**


  Uses a `while` loop to repeatedly:


  * Ask the user to enter an item name


  * Stop the loop when the user types `"quit"`


  * Use `get_price()` to look up the item’s cost


  * Add the cost to a running total


  * Ignore unknown items (price `0`) but still continue the loop


  After the loop ends, print the final total in the format:


  ```

  Total: £X.XX

  ```


  For example, if the user enters `cola`, `water`, `biscuits`, `quit`, the
  output should be:


  ```

  Total: £3.00

  ```
