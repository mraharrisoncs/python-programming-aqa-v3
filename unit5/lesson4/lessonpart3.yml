  ## PRIMM Make solution


  Here is a possible solution to the previous **PRIMM** Make activity:


  ```python

  def word_score():
      # initialise total score 
      total_score = 0
      # initialise Boolean flag (if using)
      done = False
      while not done:
          # input letter
          letter = input("Enter a letter: ")
          # check for sentinel
          if letter == ".":
              done = True
          # calculate letter score
          else:
              if letter in "aeiou":
                  score = 1
              elif letter in "qxz":
                  score = 3
              else:
                  score = 2
          # add to total score
              total_score += score
      # return total score
      return total_score

  # main program

  print("Enter a word, letter by letter,")

  print("full stop to finish.")

  print(f"Your word scored: {word_score()}")

  ```


  This solution is available in the attached file `word_game_solution.py `as
  well as a more structured solution with two functions, one for the input and
  calculation of a single letter score, and one for the main loop.
