title: Simple while loops

  ## Python while


  Remember this program?


  ```python

  password = ""

  while len(password) < 10:
    password = input("type a new password, minimum length 10 characters: ")
  print(f"your new password is {password}")

  ```


  Let's look at this code in more detail.&#x20;


  First we set password to the empty string with `password = ""`. If we didn't
  do this, the conditional on the next line would fail trying to use the
  variable `password` before is has been assigned a value. This would throw
  a **Name Error** at runtime in Python.


  The second line is our `while` statement. After the `while` keyword is a
  conditional or **Boolean expression**. We met these in Unit 4.  Remember, an
  **expression** is any valid sequence of **terms** and **operators** that can
  be **evaluated** to obtain a result. Just like the `if` statement,
  `while` takes a **Boolean expression**, which evaluates to either `True` or
  `False`. 


  We met `len()` in unit 3, it returns the length of a string. So the expression
  `len(password) < 10` will be `True` if string stored in the
  `password` variable is less than ten characters long. If the expression is
  `True` then Python will enter the loop and execute the code block that follows
  the colon `:`


  When this program runs for the first time, we know that password is set to
  `""` which has length of zero. Zero is less than ten, so the expression
  evaluates to `True` and the indented code block is executed. Line 3 will now
  run, and ask the user for a password. After this there is no more indented
  code, so Python loops back to the `while` statement.


  If the inputted password has less than ten characters, the condition evaluates
  to `True` again, and the indented code block is executed once more. This
  happens every time the user inputs a password that is too short.


  However once the new password has ten characters or more, the expression
  `len(password) < 10` will evaluate to `False` and the while loop will
  `terminate` - this means it will skip the indented code block and execute the
  next line that is not indented. This means the `print()` statement will now
  execute!


  ## Flowchart for while


  Here is a flowchart to illustrate what is going on:

    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What will happen if the initial value of 'password' is not set before
          the while loop?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: The program will throw a Name Error at runtime.
            explanation: Without initializing 'password', the variable is used before
              assignment, causing a Name Error.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: The program will run without any errors.
            explanation: The program will not run correctly because 'password' is used
              before it is assigned a value.
          - id: "3"
            value: The while loop will execute indefinitely.
            explanation: The loop will not execute indefinitely; it will throw a Name Error
              before the loop starts.
  - id: "2"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What will happen if the user inputs a password with 8 characters?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: The while loop will continue to run and prompt for a new password.
            explanation: The condition 'len(password) \< 10' will evaluate to True, so the
              loop continues.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: The while loop will terminate and print the password.
            explanation: The loop only terminates when the password is 10 characters or
              more.
          - id: "3"
            value: The program will throw a Name Error.
            explanation: A Name Error occurs if 'password' is not initialized before the
              loop.
  - id: "3"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: In any given while loop, how does Python know which lines to repeat?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: The lines to be repeated are indented after the while statement
            explanation: Yes, the colon ':' tells Python to expect an indented code block
              and this whole block is executed repeatedly.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: It only repeats the first line after the while statement
            explanation: No, you can have multiple indented lines inside a while statement
              and they are all repeated.
          - id: "3"
            value: It repeats all the lines from while until it sees print
            explanation: No, the first un-indented line marks the end of the block and this
              might not always be print.
