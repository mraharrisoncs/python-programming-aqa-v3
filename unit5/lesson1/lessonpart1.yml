title: Why condition-controlled iteration?
content: >
  ## Iteration


  To iterate is to repeat a process. Iterating means repeating or
  looping.\*&#x20;


  Programs with only sequence and selection must come to an end, they can't
  repeat steps. This is not very useful when you want keep processing input
  until some goal is achieved, such as completing a game, calculating the
  company payroll or simply getting your password correct after multiple
  attempts.


  In short, we need **iteration**, along with **sequence** and **selection**, to
  make useful programs.


  > \**Strictly speaking,* **iteration** *means processing all the elements in a
  list one by one, but we usually use the word* **iteration** *interchangeably
  with* **repetition** *at this stage of study.*


  ## Condition-controlled iteration


  This is the first kind of iteration we will look at, it's the kind that stops
  when something happens. It's called **condition-controlled** because the loop
  continues or ends according to a **condition** - an expression that can
  evaluate to `True` or `False`. 


  > Tip: **condition-controlled** iteration is also called **indefinite
  iteration** because we don't know how many times the loop will run. We will
  look at **count-controlled** or **definite** iteration later, which means
  looping a set number of times using a count.


  ## Python while statement


  We use a **while** statement in Python, which runs a code block until a
  **condition** becomes False. We met **conditions** in Unit 4, they are
  **Boolean expressions** you can use on an **`if`** or **`elif`** statement,
  and you can use them after **`while`** too. Here is a short program that uses
  a simple while loop to ensure a password is at least ten characters long:


  ```python

  password = ""

  while len(password) < 10:
    password = input("type a new password, minimum length 10 characters: ")
  print(f"your new password is {password}")

  ```


  The line `while len(password) < 10:` can be read aloud as "while length of
  password is less than 10". Python evaluates the **Boolean
  expression** `len(password) < 10`, and if this is **`True`** it enters the
  loop, executing the indented line(s).&#x20;


  After the indented code block finishes, Python returns to the
  **`while`** statement and evaluates the condition again. If the condition is
  now **`False`** then the indented code block is **skipped**, and the loop
  terminates. In the above program, the next line to run is the
  **print** statement. 


  ### **Activity:**


  Try the code in the attached program. Type in strings of different lengths.
  Change the condition and see what happens.
