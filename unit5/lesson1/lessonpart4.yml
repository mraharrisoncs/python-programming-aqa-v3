  ## Times tables with **while**


  We can use a `while` loop with a counter, to repeat something a number of
  times. Later we will see a better way of doing this - the `for` loop - but for
  now let's use what we know.


  ```python

  def five_times_table():
    # five times table
    counter = 1
    while counter < 11:
      print(f"5 x {counter} = {5 * counter}")
      counter += 1

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  five_times_table()

  ```


  In this program, we set a counter to 1, and inside the loop we
  **increment** it by 1 each iteration. That's what `counter += 1` means, it's
  the same as `counter = counter + 1`.


  The loop continues **while** counter is less than 11, or in other words, stops
  when **counter reaches 11**. Note that it **doesn't execute** the code block
  inside the while loop for a counter value of 11. The last iteration to run is
  when counter=10.&#x20;


  Try this in the terminal now, the file is attached.


  ## Countdown to lift-off!


  ```python

  def countdown():
    # count down from 10
    counter = 10
    while counter >= 1:
      print(f"{counter} !")
      counter -= 1
    print("lift-off !")

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  countdown()

  ```


  The above program sets counter to 10 initially, then loops while counter is
  **greater than or equal to 1**, **decrementing** it by 1 each iteration
  (subtracting 1 with `counter -= 1`).

    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Why do we use 'counter \< 11' in the times table program?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: To ensure the loop runs for counter values up to 10 but not 11.
            explanation: Yes, the loop stops when the counter reaches 11, ensuring it runs
              10 times.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: To make the loop run indefinitely.
            explanation: No, the loop stops when the counter reaches 11, so it does not run
              indefinitely.
          - id: "3"
            value: To start the loop from 11.
            explanation: No, the loop starts with the counter set to 1, not 11.

    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: string
        content: In the countdown program, what is the conditional expression on the
          while statement?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: counter \>= 1
            explanation: Yes, a conditional expression is a complete set of terms and
              operator(s) that evaluates to a Boolean result. '\>=' on it's own
              is the comparison operator.

    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: If we change the third line to counter = 12 in the countdown program,
          how many times will the loop run?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: 12 times
            explanation: Yes, the loop starts at 12 and runs while counter is greater than
              or equal to 1 (inclusive)
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: 11 times
            explanation: No, the loop runs from 12 down to 1 inclusive for a total of 12
              iterations.
          - id: "3"
            value: 10 times
            explanation: No, the loop runs more than 10 times because it starts at 12.
          - id: "4"
            value: 13 times
            explanation: No, the loop does not run 13 times as it starts at 12 and stops at
              1.
