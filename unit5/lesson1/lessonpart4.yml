  ## Times tables with **while**


  We can use a `while` loop with a counter, to repeat something a number of
  times. Later we will see a better way of doing this - the `for` loop - but for
  now let's use what we know.


  ```python

  def five_times_table():
    # five times table
    counter = 1
    while counter < 11:
      print(f"5 x {counter} = {5 * counter}")
      counter += 1

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  five_times_table()

  ```


  In this program, we set a counter to 1, and inside the loop we
  **increment** it by 1 each iteration. That's what `counter += 1` means, it's
  the same as `counter = counter + 1`.


  The loop continues **while** counter is less than 11, or in other words, stops
  when **counter reaches 11**. Note that it **doesn't execute** the code block
  inside the while loop for a counter value of 11. The last iteration to run is
  when counter=10.&#x20;


  Try this in the terminal now, the file is attached.


  ## Countdown to lift-off!


  ```python

  def countdown():
    # count down from 10
    counter = 10
    while counter >= 1:
      print(f"{counter} !")
      counter -= 1
    print("lift-off !")

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  countdown()

  ```


  The above program sets counter to 10 initially, then loops while counter is
  greater than or equal to 1, decrementing it by 1 each iteration (subtracting 1
  with `counter -= 1`)


  ### Try It Yourself


  Modify the `display_times_table` function to display the times table for a
  different number. Experiment with changing the loop condition to display more
  or fewer multipliers.
