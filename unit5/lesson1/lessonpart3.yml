title: More while loops
content: >
  # Structured programming with while loops


  Let's put our password length checker into a subprogram - a function that
  inputs and validates a new password:


  ```python

  def get_password():
    password = ""
    while len(password) < 10:
      password = input("type a new password, minimum length 10 characters: ")
    return password

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  print("Let's set your password!")

  password = get_password()

  print(f"your new password is {password}")
    
  ```


  Now we can call `get_password()` to input and validate a new password any time
  we want it! Also if we want to improve our password routine - say, to check
  password strength other than just number of characters - we can just update
  the `get_password()` function. When we **structure** our program like this,
  into **subprograms**, this makes debugging and maintenance easier.


  Let's add another feature: **requesting the password a second time.** Lots of
  websites do this - it makes sure you know what password you have typed, when
  the field is obscured so "shoulder surfers" can't steal your password!


  Here is the enhanced code:


  ```python

  def get_password():
    
    # input password repeatedly until length at least 10 characters
    password = ""
    while len(password) < 10:
      password = input("type a new password, minimum length 10 characters: ")
    
    # input password again until it matches first password
    password_repeat = ""
    while password_repeat != password:
      password_repeat = input("type your new password again: ")
    
    # return the new password (either variable will do as they are the same!)
    return password


  # MAIN PROGRAM

  print("Let's set your password!")

  password = get_password()

  print(f"your new password is {password}")
    
  ```


  We have added a second `while` loop, which inputs the second password string,
  and checks this against the first. This time the **condition** uses the
  `!=` operator, which means **not equal to.** Both of these loops are
  **condition-controlled** because they end when their **condition** changes
  from `True` to `False`. 


  ## Activity: Try the program


  Try the code now in the given Python file. Try passwords of different lengths,
  two strings that do not match, and finally two strings that do match. Then
  answer these questions.

    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What is the purpose of the second while loop in the get_password
          function?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: To ensure the password is at least 10 characters long.
            explanation: This is the purpose of the first while loop.
          - id: "2"
            value: To confirm that the user knows the password they have typed.
            explanation: Yes, the second while loop ensures the user retypes the password
              correctly.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "3"
            value: To check the strength of the password.
            explanation: The code does not check password strength beyond length.
  - id: "2"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What is the purpose of the first while loop in the get_password
          function?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: To ensure the password is at least 10 characters long.
            explanation: The first while loop checks if the password length is less than 10
              and continues to prompt the user until a valid length is entered.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: To check if the password matches the repeated password.
            explanation: The first while loop does not compare the password with the
              repeated password; it only checks the length.
          - id: "3"
            value: To ensure the password contains both letters and numbers.
            explanation: The first while loop does not check the content of the password,
              only its length.
  - id: "3"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: string
        content: What comparison operator is used in the second while loop to check if
          the repeated password is different to the first password?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "!="
            explanation: The '!=' operator means 'not equal to', ensuring the loop continues
              until the passwords match.
            isCorrect: true
  - id: "4"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Why do we use != in the second loop and not == ?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: To ensure the loop continues while the repeated password is different to
              the first password.
            explanation: Yes, we use != to keep looping while they are not equal, and end
              when they are equal.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: To ensure the loop continues until the repeated password is different
              from the first password.
            explanation: Using != would stop the loop if the passwords are different, which
              is not the desired behavior.
          - id: "3"
            value: To ensure the loop continues while the repeated password is less than ten
              characters long.
            explanation: No, this is the behaviour of the first loop, not the second.
  - id: "5"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What is the Boolean value of 'password_repeat != password' if both
          values are the same?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "False"
            explanation: Yes, the '!=' operator returns False when both values are the same,
              and this terminates the loop.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "True"
            explanation: No, the '!=' operator returns True only when the values are
              different (not equal).
