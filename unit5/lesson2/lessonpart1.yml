title: Using compound expressions
content: >+
  So far, we have used simple Boolean expressions in our while loops:
  `len(password) <-10` and `password_repeat != password`. But we can use a
  compound Boolean expression, one that combines multiple conditions using
  logical operators such as `and`, `or`, and `not`. This can make our loops more
  powerful and flexible.


  Let's revisit the `get_password` program and enhance it to ensure that the
  password not only meets a minimum length requirement but also contains both
  uppercase and lowercase letters. This will demonstrate the use of compound
  expressions in a while loop.


  Here is the enhanced version of the program:


  ```python

  def get_password():
      # input password repeatedly until it meets all criteria
      password = ""
      while len(password) < 10 or not any(c.isupper() for c in password) or not any(c.islower() for c in password):
          password = input("Type a new password, minimum length 10 characters, with both uppercase and lowercase letters: ")
      
      # input password again until it matches the first password
      password_repeat = ""
      while password_repeat != password:
          password_repeat = input("Type your new password again: ")
      
      # return the new password
      return password
  ```


  ### Key Points:


  * **Compound Expression in While Loop**: The condition in the first `while`
  loop uses a compound expression: `len(password) < 10 or not any(c.isupper()
  for c in password) or not any(c.islower() for c in password)`. This ensures
  that the loop continues until the password is at least 10 characters long and
  contains both uppercase and lowercase letters. 


  * **Logical Operators**: The `or` operator is used to combine multiple
  conditions. The loop will continue if any of the conditions are true, meaning
  the password does not yet meet all the criteria.


  * **String Methods**: The `any()` function checks if any character in the
  password is uppercase or lowercase using `c.isupper()` and `c.islower()`.


  By using compound expressions, we can create more complex and robust
  validation logic in our programs. Try modifying the program to add additional
  criteria, such as requiring a number or special character, to further practice
  using compound expressions in while loops.
