title: Using compound expressions
content: >
  So far, we have used simple Boolean expressions in our while loops:
  `len(password) <-10` and `password_repeat != password`. But we can use a
  compound Boolean expression, one that combines multiple conditions using
  logical operators such as `and`, `or`, and `not`. This can make our loops more
  powerful and flexible.


  Let's revisit the `get_password` program and enhance it to ensure that the
  password not only meets a minimum length requirement but also **starts with an
  uppercase letter** and **contains a hash symbol,** **`#`.**


  Here is the enhanced version of the function:


  ```python

  def get_password():
      # input password repeatedly until it meets all criteria
      password = ""
      while len(password) < 10 or not password[0].isupper() or '#' not in password:
          password = input("Type new password, min length 10," \
                            + " first uppercase, include #: ")
        
      # input password again until it matches the first password
      password_repeat = ""
      while password_repeat != password:
          password_repeat = input("Type your new password again: ")
      
      # return the new password
      return password
  ```


  #### Explanation


  Let's look at that first compound condition in detail. It contains three
  separate conditions:


  * `len(password) < 10` - we met this earlier, this will be `True` if the
  password is too short.


  * `not password[0].isupper()` - this grabs the first character of the password
  with `password[0]` then uses the `isupper()` string method, which
  returns `True` if this is uppercase. Finally we negate this result using
  `not`, so this condition will be `True` if the first character is **not** an
  uppercase letter - another indicator that our password is invalid.


  * `'#' not in password` - this uses the string comparison operator `not
  in` (see Unit 3) which returns `True` when\*\* \*\*a substring is **not in** a
  larger string, in this case when there is no `#` symbol in our password - the
  final indicator for an invalid password.


  These three conditions are connected with Boolean `or` operators. That's
  because if any one of them is `True`, our password is too weak and must be
  rejected, and the `while` loop will continue running. Only when all three
  conditions are `False` will our loop terminate.


  > ## Negative thinking

  >

  > While loops are tricky to get your head around sometimes, just remember they
  keep looping **while** a condition is **True**. Sometimes it's more intuitive
  to state the  **terminating** condition, i.e. what needs to happen for the
  loop to **end**. If this is the case, don't forget to **negate** that
  condition before using it on your **while** statement!
