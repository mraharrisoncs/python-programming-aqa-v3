title: More while loops with compound expressions
content: >+
  Let's now write a ` check_password` program which inputs a password attempt,
  and checks against the password variable, returning `True` if correct within
  three attempts, before returning `False`. For simplicity we have set the
  password to "Computer#Science", but in reality we would retrieve a password
  from an encrypted database!


  ```python

  def check_password():
      password = "Computer#Science"
      attempts = 3
      password_attempt = ""
      while password_attempt != password and tries > 0:
          password_attempt = input(f"Type your password, {attempts} attempts remaining")
      if password_attempt == password:
          return True
      else:
          return False
  ```
