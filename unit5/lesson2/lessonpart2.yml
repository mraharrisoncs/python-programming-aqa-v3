title: More while loops with compound expressions
content: >+
  Let's now write a              ` check_password` program which inputs a
  password attempt, and checks against the password variable, returning
  `True` if correct within three attempts, before returning `False`. For
  simplicity we have set the password to "Computer#Science", but in reality we
  would retrieve a password from an encrypted database!


  ```python

  def check_password():
      password = "Computer#Science"
      attempts = 3
      password_attempt = ""

      while password_attempt != password and attempts > 0:
          password_attempt = input(f"Type your password, {attempts} attempts remaining: ")
          attempts -= 1
   
      if password_attempt == password:
          return True
      else:
          return False
  ```


  We are using an `if` statement after the while loop ends, to check the last
  attempt, and decide whether to return `True` or `False`, because we cannot be
  sure if the loop has terminated because the last password attempt was correct,
  or the attempts ran out!


  ## Returning a boolean directly


  There's actually no need to use an `if` here, we can just return the result of
  the comparison like this:


  ```python

  return password_attempt == password:

  ```


  This is because the expression `password_attempt == password` evaluates to
  `True` if the last password attempt was correct, and `False` if not, so we can
  just return that value directly.


  ## Final version of check\_password()


  ```python

  def check_password():
      password = "Computer#Science"
      attempts = 3
      password_attempt = ""

      while password_attempt != password and attempts > 0:
          password_attempt = input(f"Type your password, {attempts} attempts remaining: ")
          attempts -= 1
   
      return password_attempt == password
  ```
