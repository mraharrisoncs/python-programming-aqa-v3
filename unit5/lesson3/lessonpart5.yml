title: Programming practical with while loops
content: >+
  ## Worked Examples&#x20;


  Let's see some more `while` examples in Python, before trying some more PRIMM
  activities:


  ### Example 1: Vending Machine Coin Counter


  Here's a simple function that uses the while loop we saw earlier to input coin
  values until a total is reached or exceeded. The function returns the change
  due.


  ```python

  import random


  def input_coins(price):
      total = 0
      looping = True
      while looping:
          print(f"credit so far = {total}")
          coin = int(input("Enter a coin: "))
          total = total + coin
          if total >= price:
              looping = False 
      return total - price

  # main program

  change = input_coins(random.randint(20,500))

  print(f"Your change is {change}")
   
  ```


  ### **Explanation:**


  * We import the `random` library to allow use of `randint` later


  * The function `input_coins()` takes one parameter `price` which will be the
  price of an item


  * We initialise the `total` to zero, and the loop control Boolean flag
  `looping` to `True`


  * We now enter the loop, and inside the loop we output the running total, and
  input a new coin. If the total reaches the price, or goes over it, the loop
  control variable is set to False and the loop ends.


  * We return the difference between the total and the price - this is the
  change due


  * The main program calls the function with a random price from 20p to £5,
  saves the return value as `change` and then outputs this.


  ### Example 2: Temperature value analysis - with validation


  Here's a function that inputs temperatures repeatedly, until the user types
  "99". It then returns the average temperature.


  ```python

  def analyse_temps():
      total = 0
      count = 0
      finished = False
      while not finished:
          temp = int(input("Enter a temperature in C (99 to end): "))
              while temp < -40 or temp > 99:
                  temp = int(input("Invalid, retry: "))
          if temp == 99:
              finished = True
          else:
              total = total + temp
              count = count + 1
      return total / count

  # main program

  print(f"Average temperature was: {analyse_temps()}")

  ```


  ### **Explanation:**


  * The function `analyse_temps()` initializes two variables, `total` and
  `count`, to zero and a Boolean flag `finished` to `False`, and then enters a
  `while` loop that continues until `finished` is `True`.


  * Inside the loop, it prompts the user to input a temperature in Celsius, with
  "99" as the sentinel value to end the input.


  * If the input temperature is outside the valid range (-40 to 99), it prompts
  the user to retry until a valid temperature is entered.


  * If the input temperature is "99", the loop ends by setting `finished` to
  `True`.


  * Otherwise, it adds the temperature to `total` and increments `count` by 1.


  * The function calculates the average temperature using `total/count` and
  returns this.


  * The main program calls the function and outputs the result.


  ## PRIMM activities


  Using the attached **`email_checker.py`**:


  1. **🤔 Predict** what the program does.

  2. ▶️ **Run** and check your prediction, were you correct?

  3. 🔍 **Investigate:** why do we need `or` in the first `if` statement, not
  `and`? What is the identifier of the Boolean variable that controls the loop? 

  4. ✏️ **Modify:** Change the program to also check the email contains a "."
  dot. \
     **Stretch challenge:** can you check the dot comes after the @ symbol?
  5. 🛠️ **Make:** a new function `get_code()` that inputs a product code and
  validates it. The input string should:

     * be exactly 6 characters long

     * start with a capital letter

     * end with a number.

     For example, AX1045, Z109B4 and PPKGN7 are all valid, but X1, wn9044 and AX104Q are all invalid.
