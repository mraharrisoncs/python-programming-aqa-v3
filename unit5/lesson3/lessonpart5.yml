title: Programming practical with while loops
content: >+
  ### Worked Examples&#x20;


  Let's see some more `while` examples in Python, and then do some PRIMM
  activities:


  #### Example 1: Vending Machine Coin Counter


  Here's a simple function that uses the while loop we saw earlier to input coin
  values until a total is reached or exceeded. The function returns the change
  due.


  ```python

  import random


  def input_coins(price):
      total = 0
      looping = True
      while looping:
          print(f"credit so far = {total}")
          coin = int(input("Enter a coin: "))
          total = total + coin
          if total >= price:
              looping = False 
      return total - price

  # main program

  change = input_coins(random.randint(20,500))

  print(f"Your change is {change}")
   
  ```


  **Explanation:**


  * We import the `random` library to allow use of `randint` later


  * The function `input_coins()` takes one parameter `price` which will be the
  price of an item


  * We initialise the `total` to zero, and the loop control Boolean flag
  `looping` to `True`


  * We now enter the loop, and inside the loop we output the running total, and
  input a new coin. If the total reaches the price, or goes over it, the loop
  control variable is set to False and the loop ends.


  * We return the difference between the total and the price - this is the
  change due


  * The main program calls the function with a random price from 20p to £5,
  saves the return value as `change` and then outputs this.


  #### Example 2: Temperature value analysis - with validation


  Here's a simple menu function that allows someone to order a meal. The menu is
  organised into starters, main courses and desserts!


  ```python

  def menu():
    # Display menu
    print("Welcome, choose a category:")
    print("1. Starters")
    print("2. Main Courses")
    print("3. Desserts")

    # Get user choice and call function 
    choice = int(input("Choice (1-3)? "))
    if choice == 1:
        starter_menu()
    elif choice == 2:
        maincourse_menu()
    elif choice == 3:
        dessert_menu()
    else:
        print("Invalid choice")
    return
  ```


  **Explanation:**


  * The program displays a menu with three options.


  * The user inputs their choice, which is then checked using `if-elif-else`.


  * Each condition corresponds to a menu option, and the `else` statement
  handles invalid inputs.


  #### Example 3: Playlist Selector Based on Mood


  This example demonstrates a simple playlist selector that suggests a playlist
  based on the user's mood.


  ```python

  # Ask the user for their mood

  mood = input("How are you feeling today? (happy, sad, energetic, relaxed):
  ").lower()


  if mood == "happy":
      print("Here's a playlist to keep you smiling: 'Feel Good Hits'")
  elif mood == "sad":
      print("Here's a playlist to lift your spirits: 'Cheer Up Tunes'")
  elif mood == "energetic":
      print("Here's a playlist to keep you moving: 'Workout Jams'")
  elif mood == "relaxed":
      print("Here's a playlist to help you unwind: 'Chill Vibes'")
  else:
      print("Sorry, I don't have a playlist for that mood. Try 'Mixed Emotions'!")
  ```


  **Explanation:**


  * The user inputs their mood, which is converted to lowercase to ensure
  consistent comparison.


  * The `if-elif-else` structure checks the mood and suggests a corresponding
  playlist.


  * The `else` statement provides a default playlist if the mood doesn't match
  any predefined options.
