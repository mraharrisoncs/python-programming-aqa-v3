title: Programming practical with while loops
content: >+
  ### Worked Examples&#x20;


  Let's see some more `while` examples in Python, and then do some PRIMM
  activities:


  #### Example 1: Vending Machine Coin Counter


  Here's a simple function that uses the while loop we saw earlier to input coin
  values until a total is reached or exceeded. The function returns the change
  due.


  ```python

  import random


  def input_coins(price):
      total = 0
      looping = True
      while looping:
          print(f"credit so far = {total}")
          coin = int(input("Enter a coin: "))
          total = total + coin
          if total >= price:
              looping = False 
      return total - price

  # main program

  change = input_coins(random.randint(20,500))

  print(f"Your change is {change}")
   
  ```


  **Explanation:**


  * We import the `random` library to allow use of `randint` later


  * The function `input_coins()` takes one parameter `price` which will be the
  price of an item


  * We initialise the `total` to zero, and the loop control Boolean flag
  `looping` to `True`


  * We now enter the loop, and inside the loop we output the running total, and
  input a new coin. If the total reaches the price, or goes over it, the loop
  control variable is set to False and the loop ends.


  * We return the difference between the total and the price - this is the
  change due


  * The main program calls the function with a random price from 20p to £5,
  saves the return value as `change` and then outputs this.


  #### Example 2: Temperature value analysis - with validation


  Here's a program that inputs temperatures repeatedly, until the user types
  "99". It then outputs the average temperature.


  ```python

  def temp_data():
      total = 0
      count = 0
      finished = False
      while not finished:
          temp = int(input("Enter a temperature in C (99 to end): "))
              while temp < -40 or temp > 99:
                  temp = int(input("Invalid, retry: "))
          if temp == 99:
              finished = True
          else:
              total = total + temp
              count = count + 1
      return total
  ```
