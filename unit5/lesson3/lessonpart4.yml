title: Pseudocode WHILE ENDWHILE and REPEAT UNTIL
content: >
  ### Condition-controlled iteration in pseudocode


  As we have seen previously, AQA exam papers and reference material use
  pseudocode rather than Python. When you see `while` loops in AQA exam papers
  we will use keywords `WHILE` and `ENDWHILE `like this:


  ```python

  WHILE BoolExp
    # statements here
  ENDWHILE

  ```


  for example, our old password length validation loop looks like this:


  ```python

  password ← ""

  WHILE LEN(password) < 10
      password ← USERINPUT
  ENDWHILE

  ```


  A `while` loop always tests the condition **at the start** of each iteration.
  So in the above example, the password length is checked on entry to the loop,
  and again on every iteration. This is called a pre-conditioned loop. Some
  programming languages - but not Python - allow you to check the loop condition
  **at the end** of the loop. This is called a **post-conditioned** loop. 


  ## Post-conditioned loops - REPEAT UNTIL


  These loops are often better suited to a problem than pre-conditioned loops.
  AQA pseudocode keywords `REPEAT` and `UNTIL` can be used to create a
  post-conditioned loop. Here is the password checker loop using these keywords:


  ```python

  REPEAT
      password ← USERINPUT
  UNTIL LEN(password) >= 10

  ```


  This code is simpler and more elegant than the original WHILE version: we
  don't need to initialise the `password` variable before we enter the loop, and
  the logic feels more natural: "repeatedly input a password until it's length
  is at least 10".


  We can't do this in Python, but here is a sample of **Lua** - a
  beginner-friendly language used in game development such as in Defold and
  Roblox - that implements this post-conditioned loop:


  ```

  # Lua code 

  repeat
      password = io.read()
  until #password >= 10

  ```


  ## "Faking" post-conditioned loops in Python


  We don't have native `REPEAT-UNTIL` in Python but we can "fake it" with
  `while`. Here is our password checker loop using only while:


  ```python

  password = ""

  while len(password) < 10:
      password = input("Enter a password: ")

  ```


  Here is another example of a `REPEAT-UNTIL` in Pseudocde, this program
  repeatedly sums coin values until a price is reached:


  ```python

  price = 150

  total = 0

  REPEAT
      coin ← USERINPUT
      total ← total + coin
  UNTIL total >= price

  ```


  Here is how we can implement that in Python without `REPEAT-UNTIL`, by using a
  Boolean variable to control the loop, and changing the `UNTIL` to an
  `if` statement:


  ```python

  # Python 'fake' post-conditioned loop

  price = 150

  total = 0

  looping = True

  while looping:
      coin = int(input())
      total = total + coin
      if total >= price:
          looping = False 
  # rest of program

  ```

        content: Why is a while loop called a pre-conditioned loop?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Because it checks the loop condition at the start of each iteration.
            explanation: Yes, a while loop evaluates the condition before executing the loop
              body.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: Because it checks the loop condition at the end of each iteration.
            explanation: No, this describes a post-conditioned loop, not a pre-conditioned
              loop.
          - id: "3"
            value: Because it does not require any condition to run.
            explanation: No, a while loop requires a condition to determine whether to
              continue iterating.
          - id: "4"
            value: Because it initializes variables before the loop starts.
            explanation: No, variable initialization is not the reason for the term
              'pre-conditioned'.

        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Because the condition is checked at the end of the loop.
            explanation: Yes, a post-conditioned loop checks the condition after executing
              the loop body.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: Because the condition is checked at the start of the loop.
            explanation: No, this describes a pre-conditioned loop, not a post-conditioned
              loop.
          - id: "3"
            value: Because it repeats the loop indefinitely.
            explanation: No, a post-conditioned loop does not necessarily repeat
              indefinitely; it stops when the condition is met.
          - id: "4"
            value: Because it requires initialization before the loop.
            explanation: No, initialization before the loop doesn't make it
              post-conditioned.

          is equivalent to which pseudocode statement?"
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: UNTIL total \>= price
            explanation: Yes, this is the correct pseudocode equivalent for ending the loop
              when the condition is met.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: WHILE total \< price

              code.
          - id: "3"
            value: IF total \< price THEN
            explanation: No, this is a conditional statement, not a loop control statement.
          - id: "4"
            value: ENDWHILE
            explanation: No, the given code is a means of implementing a REPEAT-UNTIL loop.
