  &#x20;Input validation is a crucial part of programming, ensuring input data
  is correct and meaningful. While loops are perfect for this task.


  ## Why Validate Input?


  When users provide input, it may not always be in the format or range you
  expect. For example, if your program requires a number between 1 and 100, a
  user might accidentally enter number outside this range. Input validation
  helps prevent errors and ensures your program runs smoothly.


  ## Using While Loops for Validation


  A `while` loop can repeatedly prompt the user for input until they provide a
  valid response. Here's a basic example:


  ```python

  # Example: Validating a test score between 1 and 100

  def get_score():
    score = input("Enter a score between 1 and 100: ")
    while score < 1 or score > 100:
        print("Invalid input. Please try again.")
        score = input("Enter a score between 1 and 100: ")
    return score
  ```


  Here, any numbers outside the range of 1 - 100 will cause the loop to iterate,
  and ask for another input. This continues until the user enters a number in
  the correct range. The while loop then terminates and the function returns
  this value.


  ## Boolean flag version


  ```python

  # Example: Validating a test score between 1 and 100 using a Boolean flag

  def get_score():
    erroneous = True
    while erroneous:
        score = input("Enter a score between 1 and 100: ")
        if score >= 0 and score <= 100:
            erroneous = False
    return score
  ```


  ######


  This version uses a Boolean flag to control the loop. This time we are using a
  flag called `erroneous` which is `True` at the start of the loop, and is set
  to `False` if the input is acceptable. You must choose the clearest
  implementation that solves the problem.

        content: What is the purpose of input validation?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: To ensure input data is meaningful and usable by the program.
            explanation: Yes, input validation prevents errors by ensuring data is in the
              expected format or range.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: To make the program run faster.
            explanation: No, input validation focuses on data correctness, not performance.
          - id: "3"
            value: To add more features to the program.
            explanation: No, input validation is about data integrity, not feature
              expansion.
          - id: "4"
            value: To check the user has entered the correct value
            explanation: No, the program cannot know what value is correct, only what is
              valid and meaningful.

      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What is the purpose of the 'erroneous' flag in the get_score()
          function?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: To control the loop until a valid score is entered.
            explanation: Yes, the 'erroneous' flag is used to keep the loop running until a
              valid input is provided.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: To store the user's input score.
            explanation: No, the 'erroneous' flag does not store the input; it controls the
              loop.
          - id: "3"
            value: To calculate the average score.
            explanation: No, the 'erroneous' flag is not used for calculations; it controls
              the loop.
          - id: "4"
            value: To store a list of erroneous input values
            explanation: No, erroneous is a Boolean variable, it stores only True or False
