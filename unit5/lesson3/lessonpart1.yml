  ### While Loops for Validation of Input


  In this lesson, we will explore how to use `while` loops to validate user
  input in Python programs. Input validation is a crucial part of programming,
  ensuring input data is correct and meaningful. While loops are perfect for
  this task.


  #### Why Validate Input?


  When users provide input, it may not always be in the format or range you
  expect. For example, if your program requires a number between 1 and 10, a
  user might accidentally enter a letter or a number outside this range. Input
  validation helps prevent errors and ensures your program runs smoothly.


  #### Using While Loops for Validation


  A `while` loop can repeatedly prompt the user for input until they provide a
  valid response. Here's a basic example:


  ```python

  # Example: Validating a test score between 1 and 100

  score = input("Enter a score between 1 and 100: ")


  # Validate input using a while loop

  while score < 1 or score > 100:
      print("Invalid input. Please try again.")
      score = input("Enter a score between 1 and 100: ")

  print(f"Thank you! You entered: {number}")

  ```


  #### How It Works


  1. **Initial Input**: The program asks the user to enter a number.

  2. **Conversion and Validation**: It attempts to convert the input to an
  integer. If the conversion fails (e.g., the user enters a letter), it sets
  `number` to `None`.

  3. **While Loop**: The loop continues to prompt the user until a valid number
  is entered. The condition checks if `number` is `None` or outside the desired
  range.

  4. **Success**: Once a valid number is entered, the loop exits, and the
  program acknowledges the input.
