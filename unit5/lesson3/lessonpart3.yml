title: Summing numbers with a while loop
content: >
  Imagine you want to add up a stream of values: test scores, daily
  temperatures, the prices of goods in your shopping basket. We can write a
  `while` loop to repeatedly input these values and sum them. The code that
  performs this activity is so common it has a name:&#x20;


  ### The accumulator pattern


  Let's write a function that uses a `while` loop to repeatedly input integers
  that represent test scores, sum these scores and return the total. We will
  terminate the loop when the user enters `-1` (otherwise it will run forever!)


  ```python

  def sum_scores():
      total = 0
      score = 0
      while score != -1:
          score = int(input("Enter a score: "))
          if score != -1:
              total = total + score
      return total
  ```


  You can see that if the user enters the special value `-1` the loop ends next
  time it iterates. If the input value is not `-1` it is treated as a data
  value, and added to the total.&#x20;


  > Tip: A special value that terminates a loop in this way is called a
  **sentinel** value, and this type of loop is often called a **listener**
  loop because it listens for the sentinel value!


  ## Boolean flag-controlled version


  We can make the above code more readable if we rewrite (sometimes called
  *refactor*) our code to use a Boolean flag to control iteration:


  ```python

  def sum_scores():
      total = 0
      finished = False
      while not finished:
          score = int(input("Enter a score: "))
          if score == -1:
              finished = True
          else:
              total = total + score
      return total
  ```

        type: choice
        content: Why do we need to set score = 0 before entering the loop in the first
          example?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: To initialize the score variable so it can be used in the loop condition.
            explanation: Yes, initializing score ensures it has a defined value before the
              loop starts.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: To ensure the loop runs at least once.
            explanation: No, the loop will run regardless of the initial score value.
          - id: "3"
            value: To prevent the loop from terminating immediately.
            explanation: No, the loop condition is based on user input, not the initial
              score value.
          - id: "4"
            value: To store the total of all scores entered.
            explanation: No, the total is stored in the total variable, not the score
              variable.

        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "11"
            explanation: The loop adds 4 and 7 to the total before terminating with -1.
