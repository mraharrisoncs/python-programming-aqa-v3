title: Linear search with a while loop
content: >+
  The condition-controlled loop or `while` loop in Python is very useful. Let's
  explore how a `while` loop can be used to help find an item in a list. We will
  perform a **linear search** on a list of names. Linear search is a simple
  search algorithm that checks each element in a list one by one until the
  desired element is found or the list ends.


  ### Linear Search with a While Loop


  Let's consider a list of first names: `["Aisha", "Carlos", "Fatima", "Jin",
  "Liam", "Zara"]`. We want to write a function that uses a while loop to search
  for a specific name in this list.


  ```python

  def linear_search(target):
      names = ["Aisha", "Carlos", "Fatima", "Jin", "Liam", "Zara"]
      index = 0
      found = False
      
      while index < len(names) and not found:
          if names[index] == target:
              found = True
          else:
              index += 1
      return 
  ```


  ### Explanation


  * **Initialization**: We start by initializing `index` to 0 and `found` to
  `False`. `index` will track our current position in the list, and `found` will
  indicate whether the target name has been found.


  * **While Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `index` is less than
  the length of the list and `found` is `False`. This ensures we don't go out of
  bounds and stop searching once the name is found.


  * **Inside the Loop**: We check if the current name at `names[index]` matches
  the `target`. If it does, we set `found` to `True`. Otherwise, we increment
  `index` to check the next name.


  * **Post-Loop Check**: After the loop, we check if `found` is `True` to
  determine if the name was found and return the appropriate message.


  This example demonstrates how a while loop can be effectively used to perform
  a linear search, iterating through a list until the desired element is found
  or the list is exhausted.
