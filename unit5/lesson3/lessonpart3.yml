title: Summing numbers with a while loop
content: >
  Imagine you want to add up a stream of values: test scores, daily
  temperatures, the prices of goods in your shopping basket. We can write a
  `while`loop to repeatedly input these values and sum them. The code that
  performs this activity is so common it has a name: the **accumulator
  pattern**.


  ### The accumulator pattern


  Let's write a function that uses a `while` loop to repeatedly input integers
  that represent test scores, sum these scores and return the total.


  ```python

  def sum_scores():
      while index < len(names) and not found:
          if names[index] == target:
              found = True
          else:
              index += 1
      return found
  ```


  ### Explanation


  * **Initialization**: We start by initializing `index` to 0 and `found` to
  `False`. `index` will track our current position in the list, and `found` will
  indicate whether the target name has been found.


  * **While Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `index` is less than
  the length of the list and `found` is `False`. This ensures we don't go out of
  bounds and stop searching once the name is found.


  * **Inside the Loop**: We check if the current name at `names[index]` matches
  the `target`. If it does, we set `found` to `True`. Otherwise, we increment
  `index` to check the next name.


  This example demonstrates how a while loop can be effectively used to perform
  a linear search, iterating through a list until the desired element is found
  or the list is exhausted.
