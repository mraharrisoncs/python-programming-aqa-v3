  ### Worked Example 1: Validating menu choices


  In this example, which is part of a shopping program, we'll use `while` to
  check the choice entered is in the range 1 to 4


  ```python

  def get_choice():
    print("Menu:")
    print("1. Add item")
    print("2. List items")
    print("3. Delete items")
    print("4. Go back")
    choice = input("Enter a choice between 1 and 4: ")
    while choice < 1 or choice > 4:
        print("Invalid input. Please try again.")
        choice = input("Enter a choice between 1 and 4: ")
    return choice
  ```


  ### Worked Example 2: Validating an input day of the week


  Imagine we are writing an appointment booking system. We need a function to
  input a day of the week. In this function, an input string can be one of the
  days of the working week in short form ("Mon", "Tue" up to "Fri"). This time
  we will use a Boolean flag `looping` to control the loop. Once `looping` gets
  set to `False`, the loop will terminate on next iteration.


  ```python

  def get_day():
      looping = True
      while looping:  
          day = input("What day of the week are you available? ")
          if day in ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri"]:
              looping = False
          else:
              print("Invalid input, try again!)
      return day
  ```


  ## PRIMM activities


  Using the attached **`grade_checker.py`**:


  1. **🤔 Predict** what the program does.

  2. ▶️ **Run** and check your prediction, were you correct?

  3. 🔍 **Investigate:** why does x

  4. ✏️ **Modify:** Change the program so that x

  5. 🛠️ **Make:** a new function x
