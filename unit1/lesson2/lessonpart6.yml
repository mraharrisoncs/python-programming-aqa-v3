title: Passing parameters
content: >
  A subroutine that just does the same thing each time is not very useful.
  Remember our Hello World program:


  ```python

  def hello_world():
    print("Hello World!")

  # main program

  hello_world()

  ```


  We changed the greeting from "Hello World" to "Witaj świecie!" earlier by
  editing the code. But what if we want to say both "Hello World!" and "Witaj
  świecie!"? we *could* include both lines in the function, like this:


  ```python

  def hello_world():
    print("Hello World!")
    print("Witaj świecie!")

  # main program

  hello_world()

  ```


  Or we could do something else. We could make a general purpose function called
  `greet()` that outputs any greeting **passed** to it as a **parameter**. Like
  this:


  ```python

  def greet(greeting): # greeting is a 'parameter'
    print(greeting)    # output the value of the greeting parameter

  # main program

  greet("Hello World!")    # "Hello World!" is passed into the parameter

  greet("Witaj świecie!")  # "Witaj świecie!" is passed into the parameter

  ```


  Try this now in **greet.py** and add your own greeting to the end!


  ## Useful functions


  Now we can **pass parameters** and obtain **return values** we can code useful
  functions. The word *function* comes from maths, and you will be familiar with
  mathematical functions like **square root**. Let's code this now:


  ```python

  def square_root(x):
    return x ** 0.5

  print(square_root(9))   

  ```


  Try this out in the attached program **sq\_root.py**.&#x20;


  > Notice we have used the mathematical property of "raise to the power of one
  half" to find the square root. There are other ways, but this is a simple
  method that needs no external libraries.


  We can write a function to apply any formula. Remember the formula for body
  mass index, `bmi = weight / (height * height)` ? We can turn that into a
  function and use it like this:


  ```python

  def calc_bmi(height, weight):
    return weight / (height * height)

  # main program

  height = float(input("Enter your height in metres: "))

  weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kilograms: "))

  bmi = calc_bmi(height, weight)

  print("Your BMI is: ", bmi)


  ```


  Try this in the attached file **bmi\_calc.py**.


  Notice that this function takes **two** parameters, height and weight. A
  function can take *as many parameters as it needs*.

    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: string
        content: What do we call a variable that appears in the brackets after a
          function identifier, which gets assigned a value by the calling
          instruction?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: parameter
            explanation: A parameter is a variable in a function definition that receives a
              value from the calling code.
            isCorrect: true
  - id: "2"
    questions:
      - id: "1"

        content: What is the parameter in the greet function?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: greeting
            explanation: The parameter 'greeting' is used to pass different greetings to the
              function.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: print
            explanation: Print is a function used to output text, not a parameter.
          - id: "3"
            value: Hello World!
            explanation: "'Hello World!' is a value passed to the parameter, not the
              parameter itself."
          - id: "4"
            value: greet
            explanation: Greet is the name of the function, not the parameter.
  - id: "3"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Which line of code will call the greet function correctly so that it
          displays 'Goodbye!'?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: greet('Goodbye!')
            explanation: This line correctly passes 'Goodbye!' as a parameter to the greet
              function.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: greet()
            explanation: This line does not pass any parameter to the greet function.
          - id: "3"
            value: greet('Hello World!')
            explanation: This line passes 'Hello World!' instead of 'Goodbye!' to the greet
              function.

    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: multiple
        content: What does the line bmi = calc_bmi(height, weight) do?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: It calls the calc_bmi function with height and weight as arguments and
              assigns the result to bmi.
            explanation: The function calc_bmi is called with the parameters height and
              weight, and its return value is assigned to bmi.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: It defines a new function named bmi that takes height and weight as
              parameters.
            explanation: The line does not define a new function; it calls an existing
              function.
          - id: "3"
            value: It prints the values of height and weight.
            explanation: The line does not print anything; it calls a function and assigns
              its return value.
          - id: "4"
            value: It calculates the sum of height and weight and stores it in bmi.
            explanation: The line does not calculate a sum; it calls a function to calculate
              BMI.
