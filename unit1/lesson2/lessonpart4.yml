title: Capstone project - quiz game

  Let's use this principle to write a quiz game using functions.


  ### Capstone Project writing a quiz game


  A maths teacher wants a game to quiz students on their times tables. The game
  should display a question in the form of a multiplication problem, such as 4
  \* 8 or 9 \* 3, using random integers between 1 and 10 inclusive.&#x20;


  The user inputs their answer and the program checks the answer and adds 1 to
  their score if correct. The quiz should ask three questions and then give a
  score out of three and stop. 


  We can decompose this problem into these sub-problems:


  * generate a question in the form a \* b where a and b are random integers
  between 1 and 10 and display it


  * ask for the user's answer


  * check the answer and add 1 to score if correct


  * repeat 2 more times


  * output the final score.


  We won't meet repetition (iteration) until a later unit, so let's do this with
  sequence only! You can start by writing the **main program** section like
  this, just by giving reasonable **identifiers** (function names) to the list
  of sub-problems we wrote above:


  ```python

  # main program

  generate_question()

  get_answer()

  check_answer()


  generate_question()

  get_answer()

  check_answer()


  generate_question()

  get_answer()

  check_answer()


  output_score()

  ```


  Note how we have not yet defined **how** to do any of these processes. But we
  have written the outline structure of our program. We have a high-level
  **abstraction** of the program required.&#x20;


  But we can simplify it if we use **pattern matching** again - notice how the
  first three function calls are executed in sequence three times? We can just
  put these inside another function! Let's call it `ask_question`() and call it
  three times in the main program:


  <br />


  ```python

  def ask_question():
    generate_question()
    get_answer()
    check_answer()

  # main program

  ask_question()

  ask_question()

  ask_question()

  ```


  Now all we have to do is write the functions `generate_question()`,
  `get_answer()`, `check_answer()` and `output_score()`!


  Here is our suggestion for `generate_question() `


  ### generate\_question()


  ```python

  def generate_question():
      a = random.randint(1,10)
      b = random.randint(1,10)
      print("what is", a, "*", b, "?")
      return a * b
  ```


  This returns the correct answer, for use later in checking the user's
  response. We need to store this in a variable in our main program, so we will
  change the line `generate_question()` to `correct = generate_question()`.


  Your job is to **complete the code** in the file provided,
  **capstone\_quiz.py**
