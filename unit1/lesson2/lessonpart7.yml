title: Why subroutines?
content: >
  Subroutines help us organize programs into chunks that match how we think
  about the solution to the problem. Programming is problem-solving, and the
  first step is **decomposition.**


  If we **decompose** a problem into sub-problems, we can then write
  a **subroutine** to solve each sub-problem. These subroutines come together to
  make a larger **program** which solves the big problem.


  Let's revisit the "chatbot" program:


  ```python

  name = input("What is your name? ")

  print("Hello, ", name, "!")

  subject = input("What is your favourite subject")

  print(subject, "is a great subject!")

  ```


  To demonstrate subroutines we will break this program into chunks, one to ask
  the users name and say hello, and another to ask their favourite subject and
  respond to that.


  ### Python `def` keyword


  We define a subroutine in Python with the **def** keyword, followed by a name
  for the subroutine. Once we have defined these subroutines we need to
  ***call*** them in the main program like this:


  ```python

  def say_hello():
    name = input("What is your name? ")
    print("Hello, ", name, "!")

  def fav_subject():
    subject = input("What is your favourite subject")
    print(subject, "is a great subject!")

  # main program

  say_hello()

  fav_subject()

  ```


  ### Explanation


  Remember that `def` creates and stores a subroutine for use **later**, it does
  **not** execute straight away. The indented code block below the
  `def` statement is the subroutine **body** which executes when the subroutine
  is called. As soon as we stop indenting,  the definition is complete. 


  The subroutine body - the code block under the `def` statement - will run only
  when it is called by name. For example, `say_hello()` will run the subroutine
  defined previously with `def say_hello():` 


  Try this now in the attached **chatbot\_sub.py**.


  ## Another example


  If we want to draw a square with asterisks, we could do this:


  ```python

  print("******")

  print("*     ")

  print("*     ")

  print("*     ")

  print("*     ")

  print("******")

  ```


  But if we use the **computational thinking** skill of **pattern matching** to
  notice that the first and last lines are identical, and also that the middle
  four lines are identical, we could instead write two subrputines, and call
  them repeatedly, like this:


  ```python

  def horizontal():
    print("******")

  def vertical():
    print("*    *")

  # main program

  horizontal()

  vertical()

  vertical()

  vertical()

  vertical()

  horizontal()

  ```


  The mechanics of printing the horizontal and vertical edges have been
  **abstracted** away from the main program into the subroutines. You can try
  this out in the attached **draw\_square.py** program file.


  This might not save any lines of code in this example but:


  * it makes the **main program** very simple to write and easy to understand -
  we have **abstracted away** the details into the subroutines.


  * it allows us to change the shape of the figure easily by editing the
  subroutines, for example we can make the shape wider by just adding asterisks
  or spaces to the print statements, while the main program stays the same.


  * in a later unit we will see how to repeat lines of code, so we don't need to
  code `vertical()` multiple times in our program, saving lots of coding.


  ## PRIMM activities


  1. 🤔 **Predict**: what will this code do when you run it?

  2. ▶️ **Run:** what happens when you run the program, was your prediction
  correct?

  3. 🔍 **Investigate:** Where are the **string literals** in this code? What
  happens when Python sees `def horizontal()`? What happens when Python sees 
  just `horizontal()`?

  4. ✏️ **Modify:** Make the shape ten asterisks wide by changing just two
  lines. Make it ten high by adding four more lines.

  5. 🛠️ **Make**: Delete the code and write a program that draws this "I" shape
  using two subroutines.

     ```python
     *****
       *
       *
       *
     *****
     ```
