title: Procedures and functions
content: >+
  To recap, a ***subroutine***, also called a ***subprogram*** is any block of
  code with a name or ***identifier*** that performs a single process within a
  larger program.


  There are two types of subroutines: ***procedures*** and ***functions***. A
  ***function*** **returns** a value, while a ***procedure*** does not, but
  otherwise they are the same.&#x20;


  ## Procedures


  The subroutines in our previous example were actually **procedures** because
  they did not return a value:


  ```python

  def say_hello():
    name = input("What is your name? ")
    print("Hello", name, "!")

  def fav_subject():
    subject = input("What is your favourite subject")
    print(subject, "is a great subject!")

  # main program

  say_hello()

  fav_subject()

  ```


  You can try out this code in the attached **proc.py**


  ## Functions


  A function is a subroutine that returns a value. This means that as well as
  performing a small process, the function passes  a value back to the calling
  instruction, like this:


  ```python

  def get_name():
    ans = input("What is your name? ")
    return ans

  # main program

  name = get_name()

  print("Hello", name, "!")

  ```


  In this example, `get_name()` is defined as a subroutine just as we did
  before, but inside the ***body*** of the function (the indented block), we see
  a `return` statement, meaning this is a ***function***.&#x20;


  In the main program, `get_name()`  _**calls**_ the function. The function then
  executes, inputting the user's name and assigning this to a variable called
  `ans`.&#x20;


  It then passes this value back through the `return ans` statement. In the main
  program, `get_name()` becomes this value, which is then stored in the variable
  `name`.


  You can try out this code in the attached **func.py**.


  ## Everything is a function in Python!


  To simplify conversations about subroutines, procedures and functions, and
  because of the way Python 3 was designed, Python programmers don't make the
  distinction between procedures and functions at all!&#x20;


  Every subroutine is called a **function** in Python, whether it returns a
  value or not. Be careful, though, exam questions will need you to know the
  difference!


  ## Pseudocode notes


  In AQA we use the keywords SUBROUTINE, ENDSUBROUTINE and, for functions only,
  RETURN. Here are our above examples in pseudocode:


  Our procedure to say hello:


  ```python

  SUBROUTINE say_hello()
    OUTPUT "What is your name?"
    name ← INPUT
    OUTPUT "Hello", name, "!"
  ENDSUBROUTINE

  ```


  and our function to get the users name and return it:


  ```python

  SUBROUTINE get_name()
    OUTPUT "What is your name?"
    ans ← INPUT
    RETURN ans
  ENDSUBROUTINE

  ```
