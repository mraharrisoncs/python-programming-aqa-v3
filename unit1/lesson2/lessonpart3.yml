title: Subroutines
content: >
  ## What is a subroutine?


  A ***subroutine*** is a named statement or sequence of statements that belong
  together. Here is the "Hello World!" code rewritten as a subroutine.


  ```python

  def hello_world():
    print("Hello World!")
  ```


  This gives the `print("Hello World!")` statement the name or
  ***identifier*** of `hello_world`. Any time we want this subroutine to run and
  output "Hello World!" we just ***call***  it by using its identifier, like
  this:


  ```python

  hello_world()

  ```


  Notice that we write the identifier of the subroutine followed immediately by
  a pair of brackets.  The pair of brackets, `(),` tells Python that this
  identifier is the name of a ***subroutine***, not a variable.&#x20;


  When Python sees `hello_world()` it will run the code defined earlier by the
  `def hello_world()` instruction. Try this now in the attached **hello.py**
  program.




  ### Write once, call many times


  We can simplify our programs with functions. Once we have written a program we
  can call it as many times as we like. For example:


  ```python

  def hello_world():
    print("Hello World!")

  # main program

  hello_world()

  hello_world()

  hello_world()

  ```


  Try this in the attached file **hello.py** by repeating the subroutine call
  `hello_world()` many times.


  ### Change one line, not many lines


  If we wanted to change the greeting that is output by the `hello_world()
  `  subroutine, we can do that easily:


  ```python

  def hello_world():
    print("Witaj świecie!") # Hello World in Polish

  # main program

  hello_world()

  hello_world()

  hello_world()

  ```


  Notice that we changed the **subroutine** and left the **main program** alone.
  If you use subroutines in your code, then code changes can be made easily to
  individual routines, without affecting the rest of the code. Try this in the
  attached file **hello.py** now.
