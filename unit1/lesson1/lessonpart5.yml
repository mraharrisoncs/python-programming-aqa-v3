title: About data types
content: >
  When we stored the user's name earlier, we used a variable called **name**.
  Because the name contains a string of characters, we call this a
  **string** variable. Their age was a whole number, and this is called an
  **integer.** Together, these different kinds of data are called **data
  types.**


  # 🔢   🧮   📜    ✅/❌


  In Python, **data types** are essential for defining the kind of data a
  variable can hold. Understanding these types helps us perform operations
  correctly and avoid errors. Let's explore the **primitive** data types:
  **integer**, **float**, **string**, and **Boolean**.


  ### 🔢 Integer


  An integer is a **whole number** without a decimal point. It can be positive,
  negative, or zero. Integers are used in situations where fractional values are
  not needed, such as counting items or indexing:


  ```python

  age = 25

  number_of_students = 30

  ```


  ### **🧮** Float


  A float, or real number, is a number that **includes a decimal point**. Floats
  are used when precision is required, such as in scientific calculations or
  when dealing with currency, weights and measures:


  ```python

  temperature = 36.6

  price = 19.99

  ```


  ### 📜 String


  A string is a **sequence of characters**. Strings store text such as names,
  addresses, post codes, anything that might contain letters, numbers and
  symbols.


  **Example Use Case:**


  ```python

  name = "Alice"

  greeting = "Hello World!"

  postcode = "DE6 2PZ"

  ```


  ### ✅/❌Boolean


  A Boolean represents **one of two values:** **`True`** **or** **`False`**.
  Booleans are used in conditional statements and logical operations:


  ```python

  is_student = True

  has_passed = False

  ```
