title: Knowledge check quiz - input, output and variables
content: >
  We have learned about input, output and variables. Here is an example program
  that we looked at.


  ```python

  # Input height and weight, casting to floats

  height = float(input("Enter your height in metres: "))

  weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kilograms: "))


  # Calculate and print BMI

  bmi = weight / (height * height)

  print("Your BMI is: ", bmi)

  ```


  Answer some questions about this code now.
questionGroups:
  - id: "1"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: string
        content: State the casting function used twice in this program. (Don't include
          the brackets)
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: float
            explanation: Yes, height and weight are cast to floats. This allows for
              arithmetic operations on the input values.
            isCorrect: true
  - id: "2"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: multiple
        content: What data type does input() on its own always return?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: string
            explanation: Yes, input() always returns a string, which must be cast to int or
              float before being used as a number
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: float
            explanation: No, input() does not return floats
          - id: "3"
            value: integer
            explanation: No, input() does not return integers
          - id: "4"
            value: Boolean
            explanation: No, input() does not return Booleans
  - id: "3"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What punctuation mark is used to separate values inside a print()
          statement?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: comma
            explanation: 'Yes, as in print("Your BMI is: ", bmi)'
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: semicolon
            explanation: 'No, look again at print("Your BMI is: ", bmi) - there are no
              semicolons'
          - id: "3"
            value: colon
            explanation: 'No, look again at print("Your BMI is: ", bmi) - the colon is
              inside the string literal'
          - id: "4"
            value: quote
            explanation: No, these wrap around string literals but are not used as
              separators.
