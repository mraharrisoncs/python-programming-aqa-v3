title: Casting functions
content: >
  Sometimes, you need to convert data from one type to another. For example,
  `input()` always returns a **string** so we need to cast this with `int()` or
  `float()` if we want to save as a number. Python provides **casting
  functions** to do this.


  ### Casting functions


  **`int()`**: Converts to an integer🔢:


  ```python

  age = int("25")  # Converts string to integer

  year = int(input("What year were you born? ")) # string to int

  ```


  **`float()`**: Converts to a float **🧮**:


  ```python

  temperature = float("36.6")  # Converts string to float

  weight = float(input("Enter weight in kg: "))  # string to float

  ```


  **`str()`**: Converts to a string📜:


  ```python

  age_str = str(25)  # Converts integer to string

  print("Your weight is: " + str(weight)) # float to string

  ```


  You can try out casting functions in the REPL, then check your understanding

        content: Which casting function is required to change "22" into the integer
          number 22?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: int()
            explanation: Yes, this changes strings to integers
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: str()
            explanation: No, this changes integers to strings
          - id: "3"
            value: float()
            explanation: No, this changes strings to floats

    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Which casting function would you use to convert the string '3.14' into
          a float?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: float()
            explanation: Yes, float() is used to convert a string to a float.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: int()
            explanation: No, int() is used to convert a string to an integer, not a float.
          - id: "3"
            value: str()
            explanation: No, str() is used to convert numeric data to a string, not a float.
          - id: "4"
            value: input()
            explanation: No, input() is not a casting function
  - id: "3"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Why must we always use int() or float() around input() if we want to
          input a number?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Because input() returns data as a string, which needs to be converted to
              a number.
            explanation: Yes, input() returns a string, so we use int() or float() to
              convert it to a number.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: Because input() cannot handle digits directly, only letters.
            explanation: No, input() can handle numbers but returns them as strings.
          - id: "3"
            value: Because input() returns integers and we need a float.
            explanation: No, input() returns a string, which we need to cast with int() or
              float()
          - id: "4"
            value: Because input() automatically converts numbers to floats.
            explanation: No, input() does not convert numbers; it returns them as strings.

          Write the missing code in this line, which inputs a pet's weight and
          stores as a float: 

          weight = ____(input())
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: float
            explanation: The float() function converts a string to a float.
            isCorrect: true
