title: Variables in Python
content: >+
  ### Literals


  So far we have just printed ***literals***. As their name suggests, when you
  print ***literals***, Python just outputs ***literally*** what you give it.


  Anything inside a pair of quotes, such as `"Hello World!"` is a ***string
  literal***, and a number like `5` or `3.14` is a ***numeric literal***.


  ```python

  >>> print("Hello World!")

  Hello World!


  >>> print("pi approximates to", 3.14)

  pi approximates to 3.14

  ```


  This is not very useful, as we're only displaying things typed in by the
  programmer. We really need a way of storing things and using them later.
  That's where variables come in.


  ### Variables are names for things


  In programming, a ***variable*** is a ***named storage location in memory***
  that holds a value. Think of it as a container where you can store data that
  you want to use later in your program. Variables allow you to label and
  manipulate data easily.


  #### Assigning Variables


  To create a variable in Python, you use the ***assignment*** operator
  **`=`** like this:


  ```python

  variable_name = value

  ```


  * `variable_name` is the name you give to the variable, also called its
  ***identifier***.


  * `value` is the data you want to store in the variable.


  For example, let's create a variable named `age` and assign it the value `16`:


  ```python

  age = 16

  ```


  Here, `age` is the variable name, and `16` is the value stored in it.


  #### Printing Variables


  You can use the `print()` function to display the value of a variable. Let's
  print the `age` variable:


  ```python

  >>> age = 16

  >>> print(age)

  16

  ```


  #### Combining Variables and Literals


  You can also print variables alongside other text (string literals) by
  including them in the `print()` function. For example:


  ```python

  >>> age = 16

  >>> name = "Alice"

  >>> print("Hello, my name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old.")

  Hello, my name is Alice and I am 16 years old

  ```


  This will output: `Hello, my name is Alice and I am 16 years old.`


  By using variables, you can easily change the data in your program without
  having to rewrite the entire code.&#x20;


  ### PRIMM activities


  Try experimenting with different variable names and values to see how they
  work, using the code editor now.


  1. **🤔 Predict** what the code does

  2. **▶️ Run** and check your prediction

  3. **🔍 Investigate**: what are the two variables in this program?

  4. **✏️ Modify** the **assignment** statements in the program for someone
  whose age is **15** and whose name is **Sophia**

  5. 🛠️ **Make** a new program that stores the day of the week in a variable
  called `day` and outputs a message saying what day it is. For example if it's
  Monday, the program should say

     ```
     Today is Monday
     ```

     Make sure you use a variable in your code to store the day name, and use this variable in your `print` statement!
