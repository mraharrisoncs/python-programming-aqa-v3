  ### Inputting strings


  In our chatbot program earlier, we inputted strings like this:


  ```python

  print("Enter your name:")

  name = input()

  print("Hello", name, "!")

  print("What is your favourite subject")

  subject = input()

  print(subject, "is a great subject!")

  ```


  What if we wanted to ask the user their age and use that in calculations? We
  might write this:


  ```python

  print("How old are you?: ")

  age = input()

  print("In five years time you will be", age + 5)

  ```


  You can run and try this out in the code file **age.py** on the right. What
  happens?


  ### Converting input to a number


  The above code fails with a **TypeError.** We are unable to add 5 to
  `age` because it is not an integer. Don't worry, we can **cast** it to an
  integer like this:


  ```python

  print("How old are you?: ")

  age = input()

  age_integer = int(age) # cast to integer and save

  print("In five years time you will be", age_integer + 5)

  ```


  The new variable `age_integer` contains an integer, and it can now be added to
  5 successfully. Try this code in **age2.py**


  ### Casting input immediately


  In practice, if we know the input is going to be an integer, we usually save
  some code and cast it straight away, like this:


  ```python

  print("How old are you?: ")

  age = int(input()) # input age, cast to integer and save

  print("In five years time you will be", age + 5)

  ```


  Try this in **age3.py** now! 


  ### Combining print and input


  We usually save another line of code by combining the `print()` that prompts
  the user for input, with the `input()` statement. Python allows us to put a
  prompt into the input statement, like this:


  ```python

  age = int(input("How old are you?: ")) 

  print("In five years time you will be", age + 5)

  ```


  Try this in **age4.py** now!


  ## PRIMM activities


  1. 🤔 **Predict**: what will this code do when you run it?

  2. ▶️ **Run:** what happens when you run the program, was your prediction
  correct?

  3. 🔍 **Investigate:** where does the output appear? Do the quotes appear in
  the output or not? What about the exclamation mark?

  4. ✏️ **Modify:** what happens if you change "Hello World!" to "Greetings,
  People!"?&#x20;

     What happens if you insert the line `print()` above the existing line?&#x20;

     What happens if you delete the quote marks **`""`** ?
  5. 🛠️ **Make**: Delete the code and write a new program that says "How",
  "Are", "You?" on separate lines.&#x20;
