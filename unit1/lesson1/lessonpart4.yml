title: Input using input()
content: >
  Let's now gather input from users in Python using the `input()` function. This
  is an essential part of creating interactive programs, as it allows your
  program to respond to user data instead of "hard-coding" everything.


  ### Understanding `input()`


  The `input()` function in Python is used to capture user input. When you call
  `input()`, the program will pause and wait for the user to type something and
  press Enter. If we **assign** this to a variable we can use it later in our
  program, like this:


  ```python

  print("Enter your name:")

  name = input()

  print("Hello", name, "!")

  ```


  In this example:


  * The `print("Enter your name:")` line displays a message prompting the user
  to enter their name.


  * The `name = input()` line waits for the user to type their name and press
  Enter. The entered name is stored in the variable `name`.


  * Finally, `print("Hello, ",  name, "!")` outputs a greeting using the name
  provided by the user.


  ### PRIMM activities


  Try experimenting with `input()`, `print()` and variables using the example
  code in **input\_output.py** in the code editor now.


  1. **🤔 Predict** what the code does

  2. **▶️ Run** and check your prediction

  3. **🔍 Investigate**: what are the two **assignment** statements in this
  program? How is `input()` used to ask questions of the user?

  4. **✏️ Modify** the program to add another question, input the answer and
  output a suitable message.

  5. 🛠️ **Make** a new "chatbot" program using the empty **chatbot.py** file.
  Use input, output and variables. For example you might ask someone what pizza
  topping they like, and respond saying I like that topping too!
