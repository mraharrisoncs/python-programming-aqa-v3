  ### Worked Example 1: BMI calculator


  Your BMI (body mass index) is calculated from your weight in kilograms divided
  by your height in metres squared. Here is the code, also in **bmi.py**
  attached.


  ```python

  # Input height and weight, casting to floats

  height = float(input("Enter your height in metres: "))

  weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kilograms: "))


  # Calculate and print BMI

  bmi = weight / (height * height)

  print("Your BMI is: ", bmi)

  ```


  > **Note** that we use `/` (forward slash) for divide and `*` (asterisk) for
  multiply in Python. We will look at these, and more arithmetic operators in
  detail in the next unit.


  ### Worked Example 2: Favourites


  In this program we input a number, casting it to integer, and then a string.
  Note that input() always returns a string, there is no need to write
  `str((input())`. 


  ```python

  fav_number = int(input("What is your favourite number? "))

  fav_colour = input("What is your favourite colour? "))

  print("Your favorite number is ", fav_number)

  print("Your favorite colour is ", fav_colour)


  ```


  You can try this out in **favourites.py** attached and try the PRIMM
  activities:


  ## PRIMM Activities


  1. 🤔 **Predict**: what will this code do when you run it?

  2. ▶️ **Run:** what happens when you run the program, was your prediction
  correct?

  3. 🔍 **Investigate:** Why is `height * height` enclosed in parentheses or
  round brackets, `( )` ? Why have we cast the inputs to floats?

  4. ✏️ **Modify:** what happens if you change `float()` to `int()` on lines 1
  and 2?

  5. 🛠️ **Make**: Delete the code and write a new program that inputs your age
  in years and estimates your age in days (assuming an average of 365.24 days
  per year) and prints this with a suitable message. Can you then do minutes?
  Seconds?
