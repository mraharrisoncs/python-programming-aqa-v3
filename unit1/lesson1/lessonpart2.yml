title: Output using print()
content: >+
  &#x20;


  Let's look at some more examples of using the `print()` function to output
  data to the screen:


  ## Hello World again


  ```python

  >>> print("Hello World!")

  Hello World!

  ```


  This example prints a simple string to the console. 


  > A note about the **REPL.**

  >

  > When you see `>>>` in  this course, as above, it means code typed into the
  console, also called the Python ***REPL*** or Shell. Output from the command
  is shown below the code.

  >

  > The code can also be written in a program and run. But sometimes it is
  quicker to try things out in the REPL.&#x20;

  >

  > You can open a REPL on the right of the course, on some course pages like
  this one.


  ### Printing Multiple Strings


  ```python

  >>> print("Hello", "World", "Python", "here!")

  Hello World Python here!

  ```


  Here, multiple strings are printed with a **space** between each.


  ### Printing Numbers


  ```python

  >>> print(42, 3.14, -7)

  42 3.14 -1

  ```


  Notice that the commas are **not displayed**. These are used
  as **separators** inside the **print()** statement. We can output any kind of
  data, and even mix up data types:


  ### Outputting strings and numbers


  ```python

  print("The answer is", 42, "and pi is approximately", 3.14)

  ```


  In this example, both strings and numbers are printed together, showing how
  `print()` can be used to output different types of data. We just separate
  values with commas: **`,`**


  ### PRIMM activities


  Open the attached Python program on the right, it is called "printing.py", and
  try these activities:


  1. 🤔 **Predict** what the program does.

  2. ▶️ **Run** it and check your prediction, were you correct?

  3. 🔍 **Investigate:** why is there a space in the output of the word
  "vegetables"?

  4. ✏️ **Modify** the program so that it outputs "vegetables" as one word
  without spaces. Then change line 3 to say "I eat 10 a day!"

  5. 🛠️ **Make**: Delete the code and write a new program that outputs:

     ```
     Hello!
     I drink 500 ml of water
     every day
     ```

     Use a mixture of text and numbers in the `print()` statement on the second line.
