title: '"Records" in Python using classes'
content: >+
  Python offers a more reliable way to implement records, but it needs a little
  **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** knowledge, which is beyond the scope of
  this course. Here is a brief explanation, for the brave!


  ## Classes in Python


  In Python we define new data types using classes. Classes allow us to define a
  template or **blueprint** for our records, giving each field a name, like we
  did in our pseudocode declarations earlier.


  #### Defining a Record Class


  Let's define our `Student` class using Python OOP skills:


  ```python

  class Student:
      def __init__(self, firstname, surname, year, house, SAT, average_grade, EAL):
          self.firstname = firstname
          self.surname = surname
          self.year = year
          self.house = house
          self.SAT= SAT
          self.average_grade = average_grade
          self.EAL = EAL
  ```


  #### Creating Instances of the Class


  Now, we can **instantiate** (create instances of) the `Student` class for each
  student record:


  ```python

  students = [
      Student("Taha", "Hussain", 10, "Pankhurst", 104, 93.5, False),
      Student("Aisha", "Khan", 9, "Nightingale", 91, 88.0, True),
      Student("Leo", "Morgan", 11, "Wilberforce", 112, 76.5, False),
      Student("Sophie", "Turner", 8, "Barnardo", 87, 95.0, False),
      Student("Hannah", "Lewis", 8, "Barnardo", 89, 97.0, False)
  ]

  ```


  #### Accessing Attributes


  With this class, accessing a student's SAT score is now easy:


  ```python

  >>> sophie_sat = students[3].SAT

  >>> print(sophie_sat)

  87

  ```


  As you can see, we can now use the **same syntax** as the pseudocode
  expression, `students[3].SAT`, making the program more readable and easier to
  understand.

            value: Khan
            explanation: No, Khan is the surname of the second student, Aisha.
          - id: "3"
            value: Taha
            explanation: No, Taha is accessed by students[0].firstname
          - id: "4"
            value: Pankhurst
            explanation: No, Pankhurst is accessed by students[0].house
  - id: "2"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: string
        content: Write a line of code to change the 'house' value of the first student
          to 'Barnardo'.
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: students[0].house = 'Barnardo'
            explanation: This line of code accesses the 'house' attribute of the first
              student and assigns it the new value 'Barnardo'.
            isCorrect: true
