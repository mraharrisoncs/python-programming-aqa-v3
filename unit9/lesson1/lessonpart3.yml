title: Accessing and changing records in pseudocode
content: >
  Remember our student records:


  ```

  | firstname     | surname     |   year |
  house         |  SAT  |      avg_grade | EAL   |

  | ------------- + ----------- + -------+ ------------- + ----- +
  -------------- + ------+

  | Taha          | Hussain     |     10 | Pankhurst     |   104
  |           93.5 | False |

  | Aisha         | Khan        |      9 | Nightingale   |    91
  |           88.0 | True  |

  ```


  We *declared* a record data type for this data:


  ```

  RECORD Student
    firstname : String
    surname : String
    year : Integer
    house : String
    SAT : integer
    avg_grade : Real
    EAL : Boolean
  ENDRECORD

  ```


  and *instantiated* a student like this:


  ```

  taha ← Student('Taha', 'Hussain', '10', 'Pankhurst', '104', '93.5', 'False')

  ```


  Now we need to know how to access and manipulate this data, otherwise the
  records are not much use!


  ### Accessing values


  To access a value from a record, you use the syntax `varName.field`. Here,
  `varName` is the name of the record variable, and `field` is the specific
  field you want to access. This allows you to retrieve the value stored in that
  field.


  To access the** **`year` field from our student `taha`, we would write:


  ```

  taha.year          // output is 10

  ```


  This expression retrieves the value of the `year `field from the
  `taha` record.


  ### Assigning Values


  We use a similar syntax for assignment (overwriting a value), we just use the
  assignment operator `←` and the new value. The syntax is `varName.field ←
  Exp`, where `Exp` is the expression whose value you want to assign to the
  field.


  So if you want to update Taha's `avg_grade` field to `97.2`, you would write:


  ```

  taha.avg_grade ← 97.2

  ```


  This statement assigns the value `97.2 `to the `avg_grade` field of the `taha`
  record.

        content: How would you access the 'house' field of Taha's student record?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: taha.house
            explanation: Yes, this is the correct syntax to access the 'house' field of the
              'taha' record.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: taha['house']
            explanation: No, this syntax is incorrect for accessing fields in a record.
          - id: "3"
            value: house.taha
            explanation: No, this syntax is incorrect as it reverses the order of the record
              and field.
          - id: "4"
            value: taha.house \<- "Pankhurst"
            explanation: No, this syntax is used for assignment, we just want to read a
              value.

      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Assume that a student called "Leah" has joined the school and a student
          record called 'leah' has been instantiated. How would you access
          leah's surname?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: leah.surname
            explanation: Yes, this is the correct syntax to access the surname field of the
              leah record.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: leah-\>surname
            explanation: No, this syntax is incorrect for accessing fields in a record.
          - id: "3"
            value: leah['surname']
            explanation: No, this syntax is used for accessing dictionary elements, not
              record fields.
          - id: "4"
            value: leah:surname
            explanation: No, this syntax is not used for accessing fields in a record.

        content: Which line of code would assign the value 'Nightingale' to 'house'
          value of Leah's record?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: leah.house ← 'Nightingale'
            explanation: Yes, this assigns 'Nightingale' to the 'house' field of the 'leah'
              record.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: leah.house('Nightingale')
            explanation: No, this syntax is wrong, don't confuse assignment with
              instantiation.
          - id: "3"
            value: leah['house'] ← 'Nightingale'
            explanation: No, this syntax is incorrect for updating fields in a record.
          - id: "4"
            value: house.leah ← 'Nightingale'
            explanation: No, this incorrectly attempts to assign a value to a non-existent
              'house' variable.
