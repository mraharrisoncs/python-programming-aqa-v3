title: Records - Summary
content: >+
  In this unit we have learned about records. We learned that a **record** is a
  data structure that groups together related data items. Each item in a record
  is called a **field**, and these fields can be of different data types.  You
  can gather records together into **lists** or **tables**.


  ## Pseudocode for Records


  In AQA exams, you will see this pseudocode used to declare, instantiate and
  access records.


  ### Declaring a record


  This is an example pseudocode definition for a record. This one defines the
  structure of a **car** record. This might be used in a database at a car
  retailer.


  ```

  RECORD Car
    make : String
    model : String
    reg : String
    price : Real
    noOfDoors : Integer
  ENDRECORD

  ```


  ### Instantiation


  We create new instances of cars like this:


  ```

  myCar ← Car('Ford', 'Focus', 'DX17 GYT', 1399.99, 5)

  ```


  ### Accessing fields


  And we can access fields from a record like this:


  ```

  >>> myCar.model

  'Focus'

  ```


  There is no capstone project for this unit, because it's mostly theoretical!
  So below is a knowledge check quiz.


questionGroups:
  - id: "1"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Why must the data type of the 'price' field be 'Real'?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: To allow for decimal values in the price.
            explanation: Yes, using 'Real' allows for decimal values, which are necessary
              for prices.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: To ensure the price is always a whole number.
            explanation: No, 'Real' is used for decimal values, not whole numbers.
          - id: "3"
            value: To make the price field compatible with string operations.
            explanation: No, 'Real' is not used for string operations.
          - id: "4"
            value: To restrict the price to positive values only.
            explanation: No, 'Real' does not restrict values to positive numbers.
  - id: "2"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: string
        content: Given the data above, what is returned by myCar.noOfDoors?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "5"
            explanation: The 'noOfDoors' field was set to 5 when the 'myCar' record was
              instantiated.
            isCorrect: true
  - id: "3"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: anotherCar ← Car('Audi', 'A4', 'MA71 HNK', 24700.00, 4) is an example
          of what operation?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Instantiation of a record
            explanation: Yes, this operation creates a new instance of the Car record.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: Declaration of a record
            explanation: No, declaration defines the structure of a record, not an instance.
          - id: "3"
            value: Accessing a field in a record
            explanation: No, accessing a field involves retrieving a specific value from a
              record.
          - id: "4"
            value: Updating a field in a record
            explanation: No, updating a field involves changing the value of an existing
              field in a record.
  - id: "4"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: >-
          Given the record structure declared above, why would this statement
          fail? 

          newCar ← Car('Audi', 'A4', 'MA71 HNK', '24700.00', '4')
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: The 'price' and 'noOfDoors' fields are not of the correct data types.
            explanation: Yes, 'price' should be a Real and 'noOfDoors' should be an Integer.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: The 'make' and 'model' fields are missing.
            explanation: No, 'make' and 'model' fields are present.
          - id: "3"
            value: The 'reg' field is not a valid string.
            explanation: No, 'reg' is a valid string.
          - id: "4"
            value: The record structure is not defined.
            explanation: No, the record structure is defined as 'Car'.
