title: Records - Summary
content: >+
  In this unit we have learned about records. We learned that a **record** is a
  data structure that groups together related data items. Each item in a record
  is called a **field**, and these fields can be of different data types.  You
  can gather records together into **lists** or **tables**.


  ## Pseudocode for Records


  In AQA exams, you will see this pseudocode used to declare, instantiate and
  access records.


  ### Declaring a record


  This is an example pseudocode definition for a record. This one defines the
  structure of a **car** record. This might be used in a database at a car
  retailer.


  ```

  RECORD Car
    make : String
    model : String
    reg : String
    price : Real
    noOfDoors : Integer
  ENDRECORD

  ```


  ### Instantiation


  We create new instances of cars like this:


  ```

  myCar ← Car('Ford', 'Focus', 'DX17 GYT', 1399.99, 5)

  ```


  ### Accessing fields


  And we can access fields from a record like this:


  ```

  >>> myCar.model

  'Focus'

  ```


  There is no capstone project for this unit, because it's mostly theoretical!
  So below is a knowledge check quiz.
