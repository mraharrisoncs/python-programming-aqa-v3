title: Using records in a pseudocode program
content: >-
  You now know how to declare a record type and how to access or update
  individual fields. The next step is learning how to **use records inside a
  program**, especially when you have **several records stored in a list**. We
  will:


  * create several student records


  * store them in a list


  * iterate over the list


  * use fields inside each record to solve a problem


  ***


  ### Declaring and instantiating:


  Just as before, we will declare the `Student` record type, and then
  instantiate some students:


  ```

  RECORD Student
      firstname : String
      surname : String
      year : Integer
      house : String
      SAT : Integer
      avg_grade : Real
      EAL : Boolean
  ENDRECORD


  taha ← Student('Taha', 'Hussain', 10, 'Pankhurst', 104, 93.5, False)

  aisha ← Student('Aisha', 'Khan', 9, 'Nightingale', 91, 88.0, True)

  leah ← Student('Leah', 'Smith', 11, 'Pankhurst', 120, 95.2, False)

  ```


  ### Storing records in a list


  To make it easier to process multiple student records we can then store them
  in a **list** (1D array):


  ```

  students ← [taha, aisha, leah]

  ```


  This gives us a list in which **each element is a record.**


  ### Iterating over a list of records


  Just like any other list, we can iterate over it, processing individual
  elements. Because each element is a **record**, we can use our record-handling
  syntax on it, specifying field names we wish to access or update.


  Let’s write a program that finds the student with the **highest SAT score**.


  ```

  highestSAT ← 0

  position ← 0


  FOR i ← 0 TO LEN(students) - 1
      IF students[i].SAT > highestSAT THEN
          highestSAT ← students[i].SAT
          position ← i
      ENDIF
  ENDFOR


  OUTPUT students[position].firstname, ' has the highest SAT score'

  ```


  ### Explanation


  * `students[i]` gives you the **record** at index `i`.


  * `students[i].SAT` accesses the **SAT field** of that record.


  * We track:

    * `highestSAT` → the best score seen so far

    * `position` → the index of the record with that score

  * After the loop, we output the name of the student with the highest SAT
  score.


  > This is a commonly used algorithm, it's a variation on
  the **accumulator pattern** - looping through a list and processing each item
  in turn to calculate a value - in this case the highest value of a certain
  field.
