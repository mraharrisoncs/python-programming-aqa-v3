title: Using records in a pseudocode program
content: >-
  You now know how to declare a record type and how to access or update
  individual fields. The next step is learning how to **use records inside a
  program**, especially when you have **several records stored in a list**. We
  will:


  * create several student records


  * store them in a list


  * iterate over the list


  * use fields inside each record to solve a problem


  ***


  ### Declaring and instantiating:


  Just as before, we will declare the `Student` record type, and then
  instantiate some students:


  ```

  RECORD Student
      firstname : String
      surname : String
      year : Integer
      house : String
      SAT : Integer
      avg_grade : Real
      EAL : Boolean
  ENDRECORD


  taha ← Student('Taha', 'Hussain', 10, 'Pankhurst', 104, 93.5, False)

  aisha ← Student('Aisha', 'Khan', 9, 'Nightingale', 91, 88.0, True)

  leah ← Student('Leah', 'Smith', 11, 'Pankhurst', 120, 95.2, False)

  ```


  ### Storing records in a list


  To make it easier to process multiple student records we can then store them
  in a **list** (1D array):


  ```

  students ← [taha, aisha, leah]

  ```


  This gives us a list in which **each element is a record.**


  ### Iterating over a list of records


  Just like any other list, we can iterate over it, processing individual
  elements. Because each element is a **record**, we can use our record-handling
  syntax on it, specifying field names we wish to access or update.


  Let’s write a program that finds the student with the **highest SAT score**.


  ```

  highestSAT ← 0

  position ← 0


  FOR i ← 0 TO LEN(students) - 1
      IF students[i].SAT > highestSAT THEN
          highestSAT ← students[i].SAT
          position ← i
      ENDIF
  ENDFOR


  OUTPUT students[position].firstname, ' has the highest SAT score'

  ```


  ### Explanation


  * `students[i]` gives you the **record** at index `i`.


  * `students[i].SAT` accesses the **SAT field** of that record.


  * We track:

    * `highestSAT` → the best score seen so far

    * `position` → the index of the record with that score

  * After the loop, we output the name of the student with the highest SAT
  score.


  > This is a commonly used algorithm, it's a variation on
  the **accumulator pattern** - looping through a list and processing each item
  in turn to calculate a value - in this case the highest value of a certain
  field.


  Now answer these questions:
questionGroups:
  - id: "1"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What does this line of code do? students ← [taha, aisha, leah]
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: It creates a list containing three student records.
            explanation: Yes, it stores the student records taha, aisha, and leah in a list.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: It declares a new record type called 'students'.
            explanation: No, it does not declare a new record type; it creates a list.
          - id: "3"
            value: It updates the SAT score for each student in the list.
            explanation: No, it does not update any SAT scores; it only creates a list.
          - id: "4"
            value: It outputs the names of the students in the list.
            explanation: No, it does not output anything; it creates a list.
  - id: "2"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Given the student records above, what would be output of the
          instruction OUTPUT(leah.year)?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "11"
            explanation: Yes, Leah's year is 11 as declared in the record.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "10"
            explanation: No, 10 is Taha's year, not Leah's.
          - id: "3"
            value: "9"
            explanation: No, 9 is Aisha's year, not Leah's.
          - id: "4"
            value: "12"
            explanation: No, 12 is not the year for any student in the records.
  - id: "3"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Given a list of students stored in the 'students' list variable, how
          would we access the third student's SAT score without knowing the
          record name (remembering that the first student has index 0)?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: students[2].SAT
            explanation: Yes, this accesses the SAT field of the third student in the list.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: students[2][SAT]
            explanation: No, this is not the correct syntax for accessing fields of a
              record.
          - id: "3"
            value: students[3].SAT
            explanation: This accesses the SAT field of the fourth student, not the third.
          - id: "4"
            value: students[2]['SAT']
            explanation: No, this is not the correct syntax for accessing fields of a
              record.
