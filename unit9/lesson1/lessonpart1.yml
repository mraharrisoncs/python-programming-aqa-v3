title: Introduction to records
content: >+
  A record is a data structure that groups together related data items. Each
  item in a record is called a field, and these fields can be of different data
  types. Records are useful for organizing data that belongs together, making it
  easier to manage and access.


  ### School database


  Your school uses a **database** to store information about students. Each
  student is stored as a **record** in the database. The **fields** in each
  **record** might include `firstname`, `surname`, `year`, `house`, `SAT`,
  `avg_grade`, `EAL.`


  This **students** table would look something like this:


  ```

  | firstname     | surname     |   year |
  house         |  SAT  |      avg_grade | EAL   |

  | ------------- + ----------- + -------+ ------------- + ----- +
  -------------- + ------+

  | Taha          | Hussain     |     10 | Pankhurst     |   104
  |           93.5 | False |

  | Aisha         | Khan        |      9 | Nightingale   |    91
  |           88.0 | True  |

  ```


  ### Music App


  In a music streaming app, each track can be represented as a record. A track
  record might include fields like `title`, `artist`, `album`, `duration`, and
  `genre`.
