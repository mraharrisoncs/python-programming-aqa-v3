title: Introduction to records
content: >
  A record is a data structure that groups together related data items. Each
  item in a record is called a field, and these fields can be of different data
  types. Records are useful for organizing data that belongs together, making it
  easier to manage and access.


  ### School database


  Your school uses a database which represents each student as a record. A
  student record might include fields such as `name`, `age`, `grade`, and
  `student_id`.


  | Name       | DOB        | Form | House | Student ID |

  | ---------- | ---------- | ---- | ----- | ---------- |

  | John Doe   | 2005-06-15 | 10A  | Red   | 12345      |
