title: '"Records" in Python using 2D arrays'
content: >
  Python does not have a built-in record data structure. There are a few ways of
  implementing a record-like structure, and we've met one of them before, the 2D
  array or **list of lists**. Remember, Python does not care if you mix data
  types in a list, so a Python 2D array can stand in for a table of records.


  ### Records as a 2D array


  ```python

  # create a 2D array of student records, each containing 

  # first name, surname, year group, house, SAT, average grade, EAL status

  students = [
      ["Taha",     "Hussain",   10, "Pankhurst",   104, 93.5,  False],
      ["Aisha",    "Khan",       9, "Nightingale",  91, 88.0,  True],
      ["Leo",      "Morgan",    11, "Wilberforce", 112, 76.5,  False],
      ["Sophie",   "Turner",     8, "Barnardo",     87, 95.0,  False],
      ["Hannah",   "Lewis",      8, "Barnardo",     89, 97.0,  False]
  ]

  ```


  The drawback of this implementation is that **fields don't have names**, only
  indices. For example, to display the SAT score of Sophie's record, we would
  write `students[3][4]`:


  ```python

  >>> students[3][4]

  87

  ```


  But we can make this more readable if we store the indices of the field names
  in constants, like this:


  ```python

  FIRSTNAME = 0

  SURNAME = 1

  YEAR = 2

  HOUSE = 3

  SAT = 4

  AVERAGE_GRADE = 5

  EAL = 6

  ```


  > Tip: Python doesn't have true constants, so we use ALL CAPS to indicate
  these variables must never be changed!


  Now the expression to access Sophies SAT score looks like this:


  ```python

  >>> students[3][SAT]

  87

  ```


  This looks similar to the pseudocode expression `students[3].SAT` and makes
  the program much more readable.


  Try the 2D array version of the student records program in the attached Python
  file and answer these questions.
