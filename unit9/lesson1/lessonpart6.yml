title: '"Records" in Python'
content: >
  Python does not have a built-in record data structure. There are a few ways of
  implementing a record-like structure, and we've met one of them before, the 2D
  array or **list of lists**. Remember, Python does not care if you mix data
  types in a list, so a Python 2D array can stand in for a table of records:


  ```python

  # create a 2D array of student records, each containing 

  # first name, surname, year group, house, form, score, EAL status

  students = [
      ["Taha",     "Hussain",   10, "Pankhurst",   104, 93.5,  False],
      ["Aisha",    "Khan",       9, "Nightingale",  91, 88.0,  True],
      ["Leo",      "Morgan",    11, "Wilberforce", 112, 76.5,  False],
      ["Sophie",   "Turner",     8, "Barnardo",     87, 95.0,  False],
      ["Hannah",   "Lewis",      8, "Barnardo",     89, 97.0,  False]
  ]

  ```


  The drawback of this implementation is that **fields are not named**.
