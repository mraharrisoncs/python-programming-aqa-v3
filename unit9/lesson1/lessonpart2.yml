title: Records in pseudocode
content: >
  Let's see how to define and use a record using AQA-style
  pseudocode. Remembering our **students** table:


  ```

  | firstname     | surname     |   year |
  house         |  SAT  |      avg_grade | EAL   |

  | ------------- + ----------- + -------+ ------------- + ----- +
  -------------- + ------+

  | Taha          | Hussain     |     10 | Pankhurst     |   104
  |           93.5 | False |

  | Aisha         | Khan        |      9 | Nightingale   |    91
  |           88.0 | True  |

  ```


  ## Record declaration


  We would **declare** the **student** record like this, before using it.
  **Declaration** means describing a variable or data structure before using it,
  so the environment can allocate storage of the correct size and structure.


  ```

  RECORD Student
    firstname : String
    surname : String
    year : Integer
    house : String
    SAT : integer
    avg_grade : Real
    EAL : Boolean
  ENDRECORD

  ```


  As you can see, we need to give every field a **data type**, which must be
  `Integer`, `Real`, `Boolean`, `Character` or `String`. These are the same as
  Python data types, except:


  * `Real` is used for the Python `float` data type

  * `Character` means a single character e.g. `"L"` or `"£"`, which is a data
  type that Python does not support, in Python we just use the `string` data
  type.


  ### Instantiating a record


  Declaring a record just creates a **template** for the record, we have not
  created any actual records yet. A new record is called an **instance** of the
  record, and the process of creating one is called **instantiation**. This is
  how we instantiate a student:


  ```

  taha ← Student('Taha', 'Hussain', '10', 'Pankhurst', '104', '93.5', 'False')

  ```


  > This instruction says "create a new Student record with these values, and
  assign to a new variable called `taha`."

questionGroups:
  - id: "1"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What do we call the process of specifying the record identifier and the
          names and data types of all of its fields?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Declaration
            explanation: Yes, declaration involves specifying the record identifier and the
              names and data types of all its fields.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: Instantiation
            explanation: No, instantiation is the process of creating an instance of a
              record.
          - id: "3"
            value: Initialization
            explanation: No, initialization typically refers to assigning an initial value
              to a variable.
          - id: "4"
            value: Compilation
            explanation: No, compilation is the process of converting code into executable
              form.
  - id: "2"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: multiple
        content: Looking at the student record declaration above, which of these are
          declared as integer fields?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: year
            explanation: Yes, 'year' is declared as an Integer field.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: SAT
            explanation: Yes, 'SAT' is declared as an Integer field.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "3"
            value: avg_grade
            explanation: No, 'avg_grade' is declared as a Real field.
          - id: "4"
            value: EAL
            explanation: No, 'EAL' is declared as a Boolean field.
          - id: "5"
            value: firstname
            explanation: No, 'firstname' is declared as a String field.
          - id: "6"
            value: house
            explanation: No, 'house' is declared as a String field.
  - id: "3"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: multiple
        content: Which of these statements would instantiate a new student?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: aisha ← Student('Aisha', 'Khan', '9', 'Nightingale', '91', '88.0',
              'True')
            explanation: Yes, this statement correctly creates a new Student record with the
              given values.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: Student aisha = new Student('Aisha', 'Khan', '9', 'Nightingale', '91',
              '88.0', 'True')
            explanation: No, this syntax resembles Java, not AQA pseudocode.
          - id: "3"
            value: aisha ← ('Aisha', 'Khan', '9', 'Nightingale', '91', '88.0', 'True')
            explanation: No, this statement lacks the Student record type declaration.
          - id: "4"
            value: "RECORD aisha : Student"
            explanation: No, this statement is a record declaration, not an instantiation.
