title: More list operations - sum, sort, min, max
content: >
  In this section, we will explore some useful operations that can be performed
  on lists in Python. These operations include `sum`, `sort`, `min`, and `max`.
  Understanding these operations will help you manipulate and analyze data
  stored in lists more effectively.


  ### Sum


  The `sum()` function calculates the total of all numerical elements in a list.
  This is useful when you need to find the total or aggregate value of a list of
  numbers.


  ```python

  numbers = [3, 5, 7, 9]

  total = sum(numbers)

  print("Sum:", total)  # Output: Sum: 24

  ```


  ### Sort


  The `sort()` method sorts the elements of a list in ascending order by
  default. You can also sort in descending order by using the `reverse=True`
  parameter.


  ```python

  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

  fruits.sort()

  print("Sorted fruits:", fruits)  # Output: Sorted fruits: ['apple', 'banana',
  'cherry', 'date']


  fruits.sort(reverse=True)

  print("Reverse sorted fruits:", fruits)  # Output: Reverse sorted fruits:
  ['date', 'cherry', 'banana', 'apple']

  ```


  ### Min


  The `min()` function returns the smallest element in a list. This is useful
  for finding the minimum value in a list of numbers or the first element in
  alphabetical order in a list of strings.


  ```python

  numbers = [3, 5, 7, 9]

  minimum = min(numbers)

  print("Minimum:", minimum)  # Output: Minimum: 3

  ```


  ### Max


  The `max()` function returns the largest element in a list. This is useful for
  finding the maximum value in a list of numbers or the last element in
  alphabetical order in a list of strings.


  ```python

  numbers = [3, 5, 7, 9]

  maximum = max(numbers)

  print("Maximum:", maximum)  # Output: Maximum: 9

  ```


  These operations are fundamental when working with lists and can be applied in
  various programming scenarios. Practice using these functions to become more
  comfortable with list manipulation in Python.
