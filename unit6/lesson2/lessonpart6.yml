title: Yet more list operations - min, max
content: >
  Let's look at some more useful list functions: `min` and `max`:


  ### Min


  The `min()` function returns the smallest element in a list. This is useful
  for finding the minimum value in a list of numbers or the first element in
  alphabetical order in a list of strings.


  ```python

  >>> numbers = [3, 5, 7, 9]

  >>> min(numbers)

  3

  ```


  ### Max


  The `max()` function returns the largest element in a list. This is useful for
  finding the maximum value in a list of numbers or the last element in
  alphabetical order in a list of strings.


  ```python

  grades = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']

  >>> max(grades)

  'D'

  ```


  Try these out in the REPL, then answer these questions:
