title: 2D arrays as lists-of-lists in Python
content: >
  <br />


  Let's see how to implement 2D arrays in Python. Remember the 


  Pseudocode


  ```python

  # pseudocode to create an array of prime integers up to 13

  primes ← [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]

  ```


  Python


  ```python

  # Python assignment to create a list that simulates an array of prime integers
  up to 13

  primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]

  ```


  2D arrays
