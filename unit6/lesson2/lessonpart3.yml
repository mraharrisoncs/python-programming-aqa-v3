title: More list operations - sum, sort
content: >
  We know we can use a loop with an **accumulator pattern** to sum the contents
  of a list, and maybe you can write a **bubble sort** too! But Python includes
  some **cheat codes** so you don't have to do those things! Let's look at
  the `sum` and `sort` functions.


  ### Sum


  The `sum()` function calculates the total of all numerical elements in a
  list.&#x20;


  ```python

  numbers = [3, 5, 7, 9]

  total = sum(numbers)

  print("Sum:", total)  # Output: Sum: 24

  ```


  ### Sort


  The `sort()` method sorts the elements of a list in ascending order by
  default. You can also sort in descending order by using the `reverse=True`
  parameter.


  ```python

  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

  fruits.sort()

  print("Sorted fruits:", fruits)  # Output: Sorted fruits: ['apple', 'banana',
  'cherry', 'date']


  fruits.sort(reverse=True)

  print("Reverse sorted fruits:", fruits)  # Output: Reverse sorted fruits:
  ['date', 'cherry', 'banana', 'apple']

  ```


  > Notes: we call `sum()` a **function** because we call it with the list as an
  **argument**, like this: `sum(mylist)`. We call `sort()` a **method** because
  it's a special function attached to a list object, so we call it with the
  **dot-notation** like this: `mylist.sort()`. This distinction helps you write
  programs, but it isn't necessary to know these details for the exam.


  Try these out in the REPL, then answer these questions:
