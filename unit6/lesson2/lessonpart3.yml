title: 2D arrays as lists-of-lists in Python
content: >+
  <br />


  Let's see how to implement 2D arrays in Python. The syntax is very similar to
  Pseudocode:


  ```python

  tic_tac_toe = [ ['.', 'O', 'O'] ,
                  ['O', 'X', 'X'] ,
                  ['.', 'X', '.'] ]

  magic_square = [ [8, 1, 6] ,
                   [3, 5, 7] ,
                   [4, 9, 2] ]
  ```
