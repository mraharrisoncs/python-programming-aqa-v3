title: What is an array?
content: >+
  We need to understand the differences between **lists** and **arrays**. 


  ## Python has lists, not arrays


  Python lists are often wrongly called **arrays**, and they can be used as
  such, but they are not really arrays. Unlike Python, some programming
  languages like **VB.NET**, **C++**, **C#** and **Java**
  support genuine **arrays** as well as **lists**. But what's the difference?


  ## Arrays are fixed 


  Arrays (in **VB.NET**, **C++**, **C#** and **Java** etc.**)** are **static** -
  they have a **fixed size**, they cannot grow or shrink. This means you must
  decide how big your array needs to be when you create it, as you cannot
  perform **append**, **remove** or **delete** on arrays. In contrast, Python
  lists are **dynamic** - they can grow and shrink.


  ## Arrays contain only one type of data


  We saw earlier that Python **lists** can contain different data types:


  ```python

  student = ["Taha", "Hussain", 10, "Pankhurst", 104, 93.5, False] # Python
  list, NOT REALLY AN ARRAY

  ```


  But **arrays** may only contain data of one type. Here is how we define an
  array of seven integers called `scores` in C++


  ```python

  int scores[7] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70}; # C++ array of integers

  ```


  Note that all these values have the same data type: **integer**. Of course we
  can define this same array as a **list** in Python:


  ```python

  scores = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70] # Python list of integers, STILL NOT
  REALLY AN ARRAY!

  ```


  But the Python version would be **dynamic**: we can append and remove
  elements, and we can also change the **data type** of elements or add new data
  of a **different data type**, like this


  ```python

  >>> scores[1] = "twenty"

  >>> scores.append(75.5)

  >>> scores

  [10, 'twenty', 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 75.5]

  ```


  ## Advantages of arrays


  Both of the above bitmap representations are valid, but the Python
  **list-of-lists** version can be accidentally changed - for example if you
  forget it's a 10 x 10 bitmap, you might append data to it, or change one
  element to a string. This would cause your program to fail.&#x20;


  Arrays being **fixed** and enforcing a **single data type** protect
  programmers from such accidental changes. This is the same reason we use
  **constants** instead of variables where available.


  ## Array dimensions


  So far we have met **one-dimensional** arrays, like `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60,
  70]`. This is a linear sequence of values, it has only one dimension, so we
  call it a **1D array**.


  Later we will explore **two-dimensional** or **2D arrays**, which are needed
  for things like game boards, bitmaps and other information that can be
  arranged in a **grid** across two dimensions (e.g. horizontal and vertical).


  ## We call Python lists arrays!


  When using Python we sometimes use the term **array** when we mean a Python
  **list.** In the AQA exams,  a Python list is a suitable way of implementing
  an array, and for the rest of this Python course we will use **array** and
  **list** to mean the same thing.


  > Note: if you are going on to study Computer Science at A-level  or beyond,
  you will need to know the difference between lists and arrays, and how to
  implement true arrays in Python using the `array` or `NumPy` libraries. Don't
  worry about this at GCSE level.
