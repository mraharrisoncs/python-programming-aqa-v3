  ## 🌡️ Example Program 1 – Highest and Lowest Temperature (Using `min`, `max`,
  `sum`)


  ```python

  def analyse_temps(temps):
      highest = max(temps)
      lowest = min(temps)
      total = sum(temps)
      average = total / len(temps)

      return highest, lowest, average

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  week = [21.1, 23.4, 26.9, 24.1, 25.5, 29.0, 27.8]

  high, low, avg = analyse_temps(week)


  print("Highest temperature:", high)

  print("Lowest temperature:", low)

  print("Average temperature:", avg)

  ```


  ### Explanation


  * `max()` finds the highest temperature.


  * `min()` finds the lowest temperature.


  * `sum()` adds all temperatures together.


  * The average is calculated using the total divided by the number of values.


  * This version is short and shows the power of Python’s built‑in list
  functions.

  ## 🏆 Example Program 2 – House Points (Using `sum` and `sort`)


  ```python

  def total_points(points_list):
      return sum(points_list)

  def rank_houses(house_totals):
      house_totals.sort(key=lambda pair: pair[1], reverse=True)
      return house_totals

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  griffin = [5, 10, 3, 8]

  phoenix = [7, 4, 6, 9]

  dragon = [10, 10, 5, 2]


  totals = [
      ("Griffin", total_points(griffin)),
      ("Phoenix", total_points(phoenix)),
      ("Dragon", total_points(dragon))
  ]


  ranked = rank_houses(totals)


  print("House rankings:")

  for house, points in ranked:
      print(house, "→", points)
  ```


  ### Explanation


  * Each house’s total is calculated using `sum()`.


  * The list of `(house, total)` pairs is sorted using `.sort()` with a `key`
  function.


  * `reverse=True` sorts from highest to lowest.


  * This example shows how sorting can be applied to more complex data
  structures.

  # 🎧 **PRIMM Activity – Music Ratings with Parallel Lists**


  ```python

  def analyse_music(songs, ratings):
      total = sum(ratings)
      average = total / len(ratings)

      highest = max(ratings)
      lowest = min(ratings)

      fav_index = ratings.index(highest)
      worst_index = ratings.index(lowest)

      return total, average, fav_index, worst_index

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  songs = ["Skyline", "Echoes", "Neon Lights", "Midnight Run"]

  ratings = [4, 5, 3, 5]


  total, average, fav_index, worst_index = analyse_music(songs, ratings)


  print("Total rating:", total)

  print("Average rating:", average)

  print("Favourite song:", songs[fav_index])

  print("Lowest‑rated song:", songs[worst_index])

  ```


  ***


  ## 🤔 **Predict**


  Before running the program:


  * Which song do you think will be the favourite?


  * What value will `max(ratings)` return?


  * What index will `ratings.index(max(ratings))` give?


  * What will the average rating be?


  * Which song will be the lowest‑rated?


  ***


  ## ▶️ **Run**


  Run the program and compare the output with your predictions.


  ***


  ## 🔍 **Investigate**


  * Why do we need **parallel lists** (`songs` and `ratings`)?


  * What does `ratings.index(highest)` return?


  * What happens if two songs share the highest rating?


  * What does `sum(ratings)` tell us about the list?


  * Why is it safe to use the same index on both lists?


  * What would happen if the lists were different lengths?


  ***


  ## ✏️ **Modify**


  Try the following changes:


  * Add a new song and rating to both lists.


  * Print a message such as:

    * `"Amazing!"` if the favourite song has a rating of 5

    * `"Mixed reviews"` if the lowest rating is 2 or below

  * Add code to print **all songs and their ratings** in order.


  * Add a line that prints how many 5‑star ratings there are (hint:
  `ratings.count(5)`).


  ***


  ## 🛠️ **Make**


  Write a function `top_three(songs, ratings)` that:


  * Sorts the songs by rating (highest first)


  * Returns the top three songs


  * Uses **sort**, **index**, or **zip** as needed


  Your main program should print the top three songs in order.
