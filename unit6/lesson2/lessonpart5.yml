title: "Python practical: more lists"
content: >+
  ## 🔢 Question 1 – Split Even and Odd Numbers


  Using the starter code in **q1.py**, given a list of numbers, create two new
  lists, one containing all the even numbers and one containing all the odd
  numbers. Then print both lists, with appropriate labels.


  **Example starting list:**


  ```python

  nums = [3, 10, 7, 4, 12, 9]

  ```


  **Expected output:**


  ```

  Evens: [10, 4, 12]

  Odds: [3, 7, 9]

  ```


  > **Hint:** Use a `while` loop, the modulus operator `%` and `if‑elif‑else`.

  ## 🔤 Question 2 – Find the First Word Starting With a Vowel


  Using starter code in **q2.py**, given a list of words, find the **first** one
  that starts with a vowel (`a, e, i, o, u`). If none do, print `"No vowel words
  found"`.


  **Example starting list:**


  ```python

  words = ["tree", "sky", "orange", "cloud"]

  ```


  **Expected output:**


  ```

  First vowel word: orange

  ```


  > **Hint:** Use a `while` loop and `if‑elif‑else`.


  ## 🚆 Question 3 – How Far Can I Travel on a Railway Line?


  Using the starter code in **q3.py**, which creates and stores a list of
  journey times *between* stations on a railway line. Write a function that
  takes one parameter, the **number of minutes** available for travel, and
  returns the **index of the last station you can reach** within that time. Here
  is a summary of the logic:


  * You always start at **station 0**.


  * If you have enough time to travel the first segment, you reach station 1;


  * if you have enough time for the next segment, you reach station 2; and so
  on.


  **Example starting list:**


  ```python

  times = [3, 12, 8, 21, 11, 15]

  ```


  **Example call and expected output**


  ```python

  >>> max_station(18)

  2

  ```


  **Explanation:**


  * Station 0 → 1 takes 3 minutes (total 3)


  * Station 1 → 2 takes 12 minutes (total 15)


  * Station 2 → 3 takes 8 minutes (total 23) → too far, greater than 18


  So the last reachable station is **station 2**.


  > **Hint:** Use a `while` loop and a running total.
