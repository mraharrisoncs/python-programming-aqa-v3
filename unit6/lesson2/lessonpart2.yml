title: Pseudocode for arrays
content: >
  Let's take a look at the AQA **pseudocode** for arrays, which you will see in
  exam papers.


  # Defining 1D arrays


  The pseudocode statement to allocate a one-dimensional array looks like this:


  ```

  primes ← [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]

  vowels ← ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', u']

  ```


  ## Accessing a 1D array element


  Pseudocode uses the same syntax as Python to access an element:


  ```

  >>> primes[0]

  2

  >>> vowels[2]

  'i'

  ```


  ## Defining 2D arrays


  The pseudocode statement to allocate a two-dimensional array is as follows:


  ```

  Identifier ← [ [Exp, … ,Exp], 
                  … 
                 [Exp, … ,Exp] ]
  ```


  For example:


  ```

  tic_tac_toe ← [ ['.', 'O', 'O'] ,
                  ['O', 'X', 'X'] ,
                  ['.', 'X', '.'] ]

  magic_square ← [ [8, 1, 6] ,
                   [3, 5, 7] ,
                   [4, 9, 2] ]
  ```


  ## Accessing a 2D array element


  2D Arrays need two indexes, which we can think of as row and column. We put
  each of them in a separate pair of square brackets, like this:


  ```

  >>> tic_tac_toe[0][1]

  'O'

  >>> magic_square[1][2]

  7

  ```


  This syntax is identical to Python, as we will see on the next page!
