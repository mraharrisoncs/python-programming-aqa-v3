title: Pseudocode for arrays
content: >+
  Let's take a look at the AQA Pseudocode for arrays, which you will see in exam
  papers.


  ## Defining 1D arrays


  The pseudocode statement to allocate a one-dimensional array is as follows:


  ```

  Identifier ← [Exp, … ,Exp]

  ```


  Where `Exp` means an expression. Expressions can be literal values or
  arithmetic, Boolean or string expressions. For example:


  ```

  primes ← [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]

  vowels ← ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', u']

  ```


  ## Accessing a 1D array element


  Pseudocode uses the same syntax as Python to access an element:


  ```

  >>> primes[0]

  2

  >>> vowels[2]

  'i'

  ```
