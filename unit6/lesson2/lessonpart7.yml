  Here are some suggested solutions!

  ## 🔢 Question 1 – Split Even and Odd Numbers

  ```python
  '''
  Create two new lists:
  one containing all the even numbers
  and one containing all the odd numbers.
  '''
  nums = [3, 10, 7, 4, 12, 9]

  evens = []
  odds = []

  i = 0
  while i < len(nums):
      if nums[i] % 2 == 0:
          evens.append(nums[i])
      else:
          odds.append(nums[i])
      i += 1

  print("Evens:", evens)
  print("Odds:", odds)
  ```

  ## 🔤 Question 2 – Find the First Word Starting With a Vowel

  ```python
  '''
  Given a list of words, find the first one
  that starts with a vowel
  '''
  words = ["tree", "sky", "orange", "cloud"]

  vowels = "aeiou"
  i = 0
  found = False

  while i < len(words):
      if words[i][0].lower() in vowels:
          print("First vowel word:", words[i])
          found = True
          break
      i += 1

  if not found:
      print("No vowel words found")
  ```

  ## 🚆 Question 3 – How Far Can I Travel on a Railway Line?

  ```python
  '''
  Write a function that takes one parameter, 
  the number of minutes available for travel, and returns
  the index of the last station you can reach
  '''
  times = [3, 12, 8, 21, 11, 15]

  def max_station(minutes):
      total = 0
      station = 0

      i = 0
      while i < len(times):
          if total + times[i] <= minutes:
              total += times[i]
              station += 1
          else:
              break
          i += 1

      return station

  # Example
  print(max_station(18))   # Expected: 2
  ```
