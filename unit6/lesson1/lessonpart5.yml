  ### Finding items in a list


  We can find the position of an item in a list with the `index()` method. This
  returns the index of the first item that matches the argument:


  ```python

  >>> planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Venus", "Earth", "Venus"]

  >>> planets.index("Venus")

  1


  >>> colours = ["red", "magenta", "blue", "cyan", "green", "yellow", "orange"]

  >>> colours.index("yellow")

  5


  ```


  If the item is not in the list, the instruction will fail with a Python
  `ValueError`:


  ```python

  >>> pets = ["dog", "cat", "hamster"]

  >>> pets.index("gecko")

  ValueError

  ```


  ### Check item in list


  Just like we did with strings, we can check whether an item is in a list with
  the `in` operator:


  ```python

  >>> pets = ["dog", "cat", "hamster"]

  >>> "dog" in pets

  True

  >>> "gecko" in pets

  False

  ```


  Try these out in the REPL now, then answer these questions.

    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Given the list colours = ["red", "magenta", "blue", "cyan", "green",
          "yellow", "orange"], what instruction would return the position of
          "green" in the list?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: colours.index("green")
            explanation: Yes, this returns the index of "green" in the list.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: colours.index("yellow")
            explanation: No, this returns the index of "yellow", not "green".
          - id: "3"
            value: '"green" in colours'
            explanation: No, this checks if "green" is in the list but does not return it.
          - id: "4"
            value: colours[4]
            explanation: No, this returns the item at index 4, which is "green", but does
              not return the index method.
  - id: "2"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Given the list colours = ["red", "magenta", "blue", "cyan", "green",
          "yellow", "orange"], what would be the result of
          colours.index("purple")?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: ValueError
            explanation: Yes, because 'purple' is not in the list, so a ValueError is
              raised.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "0"
            explanation: No, because 'purple' is not the first item in the list.
          - id: "3"
            value: "6"
            explanation: No, because 'purple' is not in the list.
          - id: "4"
            value: "-1"
            explanation: No, because Python raises a ValueError instead of returning -1 when
              an item is not found.
  - id: "3"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Given a list of strings with identifier colours, how can we check if
          the string 'green' is in the list?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "'green' in colours"
            explanation: Yes, the 'in' operator checks for membership in the list.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: colours.index('green')
            explanation: No, this returns the index of 'green' if it exists, but raises an
              error if it doesn't.
          - id: "3"
            value: colours.contains('green')
            explanation: No, 'contains' is not a valid method for lists in Python.
          - id: "4"
            value: "'green' == colours"
            explanation: No, this checks if 'green' is equal to the entire list, not if it's
              in the list.
