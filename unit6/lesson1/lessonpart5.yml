  ## Finding items in a list


  We can find the index of an item in a list with the `index()` method. This
  returns the index of the first item that matches the argument:


  ```python

  >>> planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Venus", "Earth", "Venus"]

  >>> planets.index("Venus")

  1


  >>> colours = ["red", "magenta", "blue", "cyan", "green", "yellow", "orange"]

  >>> colours.index("yellow")

  5


  ```


  If the item is not in the list, the instruction will fail with a Python
  `ValueError`:


  ```python

  >>> pets = ["dog", "cat", "hamster"]

  >>> pets.index("gecko")

  ValueError

  ```


  Just like we did with strings, we can check an element is in a list with the
  `in` operator:


  ```python

  >>> pets = ["dog", "cat", "hamster"]

  >>> "dog" in pets

  True

  >>> "gecko" in pets

  False

  ```
