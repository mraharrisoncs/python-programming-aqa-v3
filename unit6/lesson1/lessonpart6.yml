  ## Worked Example 1 - Average Temperature 


  Here is the average temperature program again. This time we are going to pass
  a list of temperatures to the function.


  ```python

  def analyse_temps(temps):
      total = 0
      index = 0
      while index < len(temps):
          total += temps[index]
      
      return total / len(temps)

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  average = analyse_temps([21.1, 23.4, 26.9, 24.1, 25.5, 29.0, 27.8])

  print("Average temperature was:", average)


  ```


  ### Explanation


  1. `def analyse_temps(temps):` - This line defines a function named
  `analyse_temps` that takes one parameter, `temps`, which is expected to be a
  list of temperature values.


  2. `total = 0` - Initializes a variable `total` to 0. This variable will be
  used to accumulate the sum of all temperatures in the list.


  3. `index = 0` - Initializes a variable `index` to 0. This variable will be
  used to keep track of the current position in the list as we iterate through
  it.


  4. `while index < len(temps):` - Starts a while loop that will continue as
  long as `index` is less than the length of the `temps` list. This ensures that
  we process each temperature in the list.


  5. `total += temps[index]` - This line adds the current temperature to
  `total`.&#x20;


  6. `index += 1` - Increments the `index` variable by 1, moving to the next
  position in the list for the next iteration of the loop.


  7. `return total / len(temps)` - After the loop has processed all
  temperatures, this line calculates the average temperature by dividing the
  `total` sum by the number of temperatures in the list (`len(temps)`) and
  returns the result.
