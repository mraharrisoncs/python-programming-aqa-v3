  ## Worked Example 1 - Average Temperature 


  Here is the average temperature program again. This time we are going to pass

  a list of temperatures to the function.


  ```python


  def analyse_temps(temps):
      total = 0
      index = 0
      while index < len(temps):
          total += temps[index]
      
      return total / len(temps)

  # MAIN PROGRAM


  average = analyse_temps([21.1, 23.4, 26.9, 24.1, 25.5, 29.0, 27.8])


  print("Average temperature was:", average)


  ```


  ### Explanation


  1. `def analyse_temps(temps):` - This line defines a function named
     `analyse_temps` that takes one parameter, `temps`, which is expected to be a
     list of temperature values.

  2. `total = 0` - Initializes a variable `total` to 0. This variable will be
     used to accumulate the sum of all temperatures in the list.

  3. `index = 0` - Initializes a variable `index` to 0. This variable will be
     used to keep track of the current position in the list as we iterate through
     it.

  4. `while index < len(temps):` - Starts a while loop that will continue as
     long as `index` is less than the length of the `temps` list. This ensures that
     we process each temperature in the list.

  5. `total += temps[index]` - This line adds the current temperature to
     `total`.&#x20;

  6. `index += 1` - Increments the `index` variable by 1, moving to the next
     position in the list for the next iteration of the loop.

  7. `return total / len(temps)` - After the loop has processed all
     temperatures, this line calculates the average temperature by dividing the
     `total` sum by the number of temperatures in the list (`len(temps)`) and
     returns the result.

  ## Worked Example 2 - Validating a Language Choice


  ```python

  def get_language():
      supported_languages = ["English", "French", "Spanish", "Arabic"]:
      looping = True
      while looping:
          language = input("Please select a language: ")
          if language in supported_languages
              looping = False
          else:
              print("Invalid input, try again!")
      return language
  ```


  ### Explanation


  This code defines a function `get_language()` that helps users select a
  language from a predefined list. Let's break it down line by line:


  1. `def get_language():` - This line defines a function named `get_language`
  that takes no parameters.

  2. `supported_languages = ["English", "French", "Spanish", "Arabic"]:` -
  Initializes a list called `supported_languages` containing the languages that
  the user can select.

  3. `looping = True` - Sets a boolean variable `looping` to `True`, which will
  control the while loop.

  4. `while looping:` - Begins a while loop that will continue to execute as
  long as `looping` is `True`.

  5. `language = input("Please select a language: ")` - Prompts the user to
  input a language and stores the input in the variable `language`.

  6. `if language in supported_languages` - Checks if the user's input is in the
  `supported_languages` list.

  7. `looping = False` - If the input is valid, sets `looping` to `False`, which
  will exit the loop.

  8. `else:` - If the input is not valid, the code proceeds to the next line.

  9. `print("Invalid input, try again!")` - Informs the user that the input was
  invalid and prompts them to try again.

  10. `return language` - Once a valid language is selected, the function
  returns the selected language.

  ## PRIMM Activity - Shopping List Program


  ```python

  # Shopping List Program


  def add_item(shopping_list, item):
      shopping_list.append(item)
      print(f"Added {item} to the shopping list.")

  def remove_item(shopping_list, item):
      if item in shopping_list:
          shopping_list.remove(item)
          print(f"Removed {item} from the shopping list.")
      else:
          print(f"{item} not found in the shopping list.")

  def display_list(shopping_list):
      print("Shopping List:")
      print(shopping_list)

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  shopping_list = []


  add_item(shopping_list, "Apples")

  add_item(shopping_list, "Bananas")

  display_list(shopping_list)

  remove_item(shopping_list, "Bananas")

  display_list(shopping_list)

  ```


  1. 🤔 **Predict** what the program does.


  2. ▶️ **Run** and check your prediction, were you correct?


  3. 🔍 **Investigate**:

     * What variable is used to store the list of items, and what is its data type?

     * What is the purpose of the `add_item() `function?

     * In the function `remove_item()`, what is the purpose of the line `if item in shopping_list`?

  4. ✏️ **Modify**:

     * Change the program to allow only unique items in the shopping list.

     * **Stretch challenge**: Add a feature to sort the list alphabetically before displaying it.

  5. 🛠️ **Make**: Write a basic text editor with the following features:

     * `add_line(text)`: Adds a line at the end of the document containing the text

     * `display_doc()`: Displays all lines in the document with line numbers

     * `remove_line(num)`: Removes a numbered line from the document.
