  The temperature program revisited


  Use this code as a starting point, rewrite the function to take a list as a
  parameter.


  ```python

  def analyse_temps(temps):
      total = 0
      index = 0
      while index < len(temps):
          total += temp
      
      return total / len(temps)

  # MAIN PROGRAM



  ```


  Explain the code.
