title: Append, change and remove list items
content: >
  ### Append to a list


  Lists can grow and shrink: they are not fixed in size. We can add items to the
  end of the list using the `append` method. Here is an example:


  ```python

  >>> fruits = ["apple", "orange", "kiwi", "banana", "pear"]

  >>> fruits.append("plum")

  >>> fruits

  ['apple', 'orange', 'kiwi', 'banana', 'pear', 'plum']

  ```


  ### Change list element


  We can change or **overwrite** a list element by using its index, like this:


  ```python

  >>> fruits[1] = "peach"

  >>> fruits

  ['apple', 'peach', 'kiwi', 'banana', 'pear', 'plum']

  ```


  You can see that element with index 1 has changed from "orange" to "peach".


  ### Remove list element


  The `remove` method can find and remove a list item by name:


  ```python

  >>> fruits = ['apple', 'peach', 'kiwi', 'banana', 'pear', 'plum']

  >>> fruits.remove("kiwi")

  >>> fruits

  ['apple', 'peach', 'banana', 'pear', 'plum']

  ```


  Note that `remove` gets rid of the **first** matching element only:


  ```python

  >>> planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Venus", "Earth", "Venus"]

  >>> planets.remove("Venus")

  >>> planets

  ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Venus']

  ```


  We can also delete items by index number with the `del` command:


  ```python

  >>> planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Venus"]

  >>> del planets[3]

  >>> planets

  ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth']

  ```


  Try out the above commands in the REPL now, and then answer these questions.

        type: choice
        content: If we start with dogs = ["pug", "spaniel"] and then execute
          dogs.append("poodle"), what is the state of the dogs list?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: '["pug", "spaniel", "poodle"]'
            explanation: Yes, the append method adds the item to the end of the list.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"

          - id: "3"
            value: '["pug", "spanielpoodle"]'

            value: '["pug", "spaniel"]'
            explanation: No, append adds an item to the list, so the list will have an
              additional element.
  - id: "3"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: multiple
        content: If we start with dogs = ["pug", "spaniel", "poodle"], and we want to
          get rid of "pug" leaving ["spaniel", "poodle"], which two commands
          would work here?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: dogs.remove("pug")
            explanation: The remove method deletes the specified item from the list.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"

          - id: "4"
            value: dogs[0] = ""
            explanation: No, this command changes the first item to an empty list but it
              remains in the list

            value: colours.append("magenta")
