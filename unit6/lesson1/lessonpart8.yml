title: "Solutions to Python practical: lists"
content: >+
  Here are suggested solutions for the practical activities on the previous
  page. You can run and test the solutions in the attached files.


  ## 🚶‍♂️ Question 1 – Simple Step Counter


  ```python

  '''

  Return the total number of steps in the list

  by adding each value using a while loop.

  '''

  def total_steps(steps_list):
      total = 0
      index = 0

      while index < len(steps_list):
          total += steps_list[index]
          index += 1

      return total

  # main program

  steps = [4500, 6200, 7000, 8000]

  print("Total steps:", total_steps(steps))

  ```

  ## 🍽️ Question 2 – Menu Ordering System


  ```python

  '''

  Repeatedly ask the user to choose a menu item.

  Only accept items that appear in the menu list.

  Allow the user to add multiple valid items to an order

  and return the completed order list.

  '''

  def get_valid_item(menu):
      item = input("Choose an item: ")
      while item not in menu:
          item = input("Not on the menu. Choose an item: ")
      return item

  def take_order(menu):
      order = []
      add_more = "yes"

      while add_more == "yes":
          item = get_valid_item(menu)
          order.append(item)
          add_more = input("Add another item? (yes/no): ")

      return order

  # main program

  menu = ["Pizza", "Pasta", "Salad", "Soup"]

  final_order = take_order(menu)

  print("Your order:", final_order)

  ```

  ## 🎵 Question 3 – Music Playlist Manager


  ```python

  '''

  Manage a playlist by adding unique songs,

  removing songs that exist, moving songs to new positions,

  and displaying the playlist.

  '''

  def add_song(playlist, song):
      if song not in playlist:
          playlist.append(song)
      else:
          print("Song already in playlist.")

  def remove_song(playlist, song):
      if song in playlist:
          playlist.remove(song)
      else:
          print("Song not found.")

  def move_song(playlist, old_index, new_index):
      if 0 <= old_index < len(playlist) and 0 <= new_index < len(playlist):
          song = playlist.pop(old_index)
          playlist.insert(new_index, song)
      else:
          print("Invalid index.")

  def show_playlist(playlist):
      print("Playlist:", playlist)

  # main program

  playlist = []

  add_song(playlist, "Song A")

  add_song(playlist, "Song B")

  add_song(playlist, "Song C")

  move_song(playlist, 0, 2)

  remove_song(playlist, "Song B")

  show_playlist(playlist)

  ```
