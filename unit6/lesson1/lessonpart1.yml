  ### Why use lists?


  Remember our temperature program? What if - instead of just calculating a
  total or average and discarding our input data - we wanted to store all the
  input data for future use? We *could* store each day's temperature in a
  separate variable like this:


  ```python

  temp1 = int(input("Enter temperature 1: "))

  temp2 = int(input("Enter temperature 2: "))

  temp3 = int(input("Enter temperature 3: "))

  temp4 = int(input("Enter temperature 4: "))

  ''' continued

  ```


  But this would need one line of code and **one integer variable for each
  value**, and if we wanted to store the temperature every hour for several
  years, that's a lot of code and a lot of variables!&#x20;


  Also, working with this data would need even more clunky code, for example to
  sum the first seven values:


  ```python

  >>> total = temp1 + temp2 + temp3 + temp4 + temp5 + temp6 + temp7

  ```


  ## Creating and indexing a list


  Instead we can create a **list** called `temps` and store **all** our
  temperatures under this **identifier.** This is how we do that:


  ```python

  >>> temps = [24, 26, 31, 26, 21, 18, 22]

  ```


  We can now access any **item** in the list as long as we know its **position**
  in the list, which we call the **index** of the item. But remember from string
  indexing, Python always counts from **zero**. For example:


  ```python

  >>> temps = [24, 26, 31, 26, 21, 18, 22]

  >>> temps[0]

  24

  >>> temps[5]

  18

  ```


  Now we can use a really cool function called `sum()` to add up all the values!


  ```python

  >>> temps = [24, 26, 31, 26, 21, 18, 22]

  >>> sum(temps)

  168

  ```


  And we can use len() - just like we did in string handling - to find the
  length of the list.


  ```python

  >>> temps = [24, 26, 31, 26, 21, 18, 22]

  >>> len(temps)

  7

  ```


  So now we can find the **average** very easily!


  ```python

  >>> temps = [24, 26, 31, 26, 21, 18, 22]

  >>> sum(temps)/len(temps)

  24.0

  ```
