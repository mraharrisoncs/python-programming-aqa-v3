  ### Why Use a List?


  In Python, a list is a versatile data structure that allows you to store
  multiple items in a single variable. Lists are one of the most commonly used
  data structures in Python due to their flexibility and ease of use. Here are
  some reasons why you might want to use a list:


  1. **Organize Data**: Lists help you organize data in a structured way.
  Instead of having multiple variables for related data, you can store them all
  in a single list. For example, if you have a list of student names, you can
  store them all together in one list.


  2. **Dynamic Size**: Unlike arrays in some other programming languages, Python
  lists can grow and shrink dynamically. This means you can add or remove items
  from a list as needed, without having to declare a fixed size beforehand.


  3. **Easy Access and Modification**: Lists allow you to access and modify
  elements easily using indices. You can retrieve, update, or delete any item in
  a list by referring to its position.


  4. **Versatile Data Types**: A single list can contain items of different data
  types. For example, you can have a list that contains strings, integers, and
  even other lists.


  5. **Built-in Functions and Methods**: Python provides a variety of built-in
  functions and methods to work with lists, such as `append()`, `remove()`,
  `sort()`, and `reverse()`. These functions make it easy to manipulate and
  manage list data.


  6. **Iteration**: Lists are iterable, meaning you can loop through them using
  a `for` loop. This makes it easy to perform operations on each item in the
  list.


  By using lists, you can write more efficient and organized code, making it
  easier to manage and manipulate collections of data. In the upcoming lessons,
  we will explore how to create lists, perform basic operations, and use them in
  simple Python programs.
