  ### Why use lists?


  Remember our temperature program? What if - instead of just calculating a
  total or average and discarding our input data - we wanted to store all the
  input data for future use? We *could* store each day's temperature in a
  separate variable like this:


  ```python

  temp1 = int(input("Enter temperature 1: "))

  temp2 = int(input("Enter temperature 2: "))

  temp3 = int(input("Enter temperature 3: "))

  temp4 = int(input("Enter temperature 4: "))

  ''' continued

  ```


  But this would need one line of code and **one integer variable for each
  value**, and if we wanted to store the temperature *every hour for several
  years*, that's a lot of code and a lot of variables!&#x20;


  Also, working with this data would need yet more clunky code, for example to
  sum the first seven values:


  ```python

  >>> total = temp1 + temp2 + temp3 + temp4 + temp5 + temp6 + temp7

  ```


  ## Creating and indexing a list


  Instead we can create a **list** called `temps` and store **all** our
  temperatures under this **identifier.** This is how we do that:


  ```python

  >>> temps = [24, 26, 31, 26, 21, 18, 22]

  ```


  We can now access any **item** in the list as long as we know its **position**
  in the list, which we call the **index** of the item. But remember from string
  indexing, Python always counts from **zero**. For example:


  ```python

  >>> temps = [24, 26, 31, 26, 21, 18, 22]

  >>> temps[0]

  24

  >>> temps[5]

  18

  ```


  Now we can use a really cool function called `sum()` to add up all the values!


  ```python

  >>> temps = [24, 26, 31, 26, 21, 18, 22]

  >>> sum(temps)

  168

  ```


  And we can use `len()` - just like we did in string handling - to find the
  length of the list.


  ```python

  >>> temps = [24, 26, 31, 26, 21, 18, 22]

  >>> len(temps)

  7

  ```


  So now we can find the **average** very easily!


  ```python

  >>> temps = [24, 26, 31, 26, 21, 18, 22]

  >>> sum(temps)/len(temps)

  24.0

  ```


  ## About lists


  We chose the identifier `temps` because the list stores temperatures, making
  `temps` a **meaningful** name for the list. Your list identifier should say
  what is in the list. It's also a good idea to make a list
  identifier **plural** (e.g. `temps`, `scores`, `days_of_the_week`) to make
  clear it contains multiple items.


  The list is an example of a **data structure** - 


  ## Practice with lists


  Open the Python REPL (the Shell) on the right, and copy/paste the commands
  above to try them out. Then answer these questions. Use the REPL if you're
  stuck.

questionGroups:
  - id: "1"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Why do we use lists?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: To allow us to store multiple values under a single identifier.
            explanation: Yes, making code simpler and more elegant.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: To store only one value at a time.
            explanation: No, lists are used to store multiple values, not just one.
          - id: "3"
            value: To make code more complex and harder to read.
            explanation: No, lists simplify code by reducing the number of variables needed.
          - id: "4"
            value: To save memory, because lists only take up one slot in RAM
            explanation: No, lists do not use less memory than multiple variables.

      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: In the list temps = [24, 26, 31, 26, 21, 18, 22], what does temps[1]
          return?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "24"
            explanation: No, 24 is the first element, accessed with index 0.
          - id: "2"
            value: "26"
            explanation: Yes, 26 is the second element, accessed with index 1.

          - id: "3"
            value: "31"
            explanation: No, 31 is the third element, accessed with index 2.
          - id: "4"
            value: "22"
            explanation: No, 22 is the seventh element, accessed with index 6 (or -1, see
              later)

    questions:
      - id: "1"

        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "3"
            explanation: The len() function returns the number of elements in the list.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "2"
            explanation: No, while the index of the last item is 2, the length of the list
              is 3.
          - id: "3"
            value: "1"
            explanation: No, there are three elements in the list.
          - id: "4"
            value: "193"
            explanation: No, this is the sum
