  ### Structure of a List


  <br />


  The string above consists of a sequence of characters stored under a single
  **identifier**, *greeting*. Within the string, each character has an
  **index** value. Python, like most programming languages, indexes everything
  from zero.&#x20;


  Here is that *greeting* string again, showing the index of each character:


  ```python

  greeting

  +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

  |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10  | 11  |

  +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

  |  H  |  e  |  l  |  l  |  o  |     |  W  |  o  |  r  |  l  |  d  |  !  |

  +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

  ```


  As you can see, the 'H' in "Hello World!" has index zero, the space between
  words has index 5, and the exclamation mark at the end has index 11.
