title: List slicing
content: >
  You've seen how to access individual elements in a list using their index
  positions. What if we want a sequence of more than one element, e.g. the first
  three or the last two?


  The basic Python syntax for **list slicing**, is this:


  ```python

  identifier[start : end]

  ```


  where **identifier** is our variable name, **start** is the starting position
  of the sequence, and **end** is the first element we **don't want!** Just like
  in string slicing, we must make the second value **one more** than the last
  element we want to extract.


  Remember our `fruits = ["apple", "orange", "kiwi", "banana", "pear"]` list
  example? Let's see how to slice that up.


  ### Structure of a list


  Here is that **fruits** list again, showing the index of each element:


  ```python

  fruits

  +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

  |   0    |   1    |   2    |   3    |   4    |

  +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

  | apple  | orange |  kiwi  | banana |  pear  |  

  +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

  ```


  ### Indexing from the start


  We've seen already we can access individual elements by their index position,
  counting from zero:


  ```python

  >>> fruits = ["apple", "orange", "kiwi", "banana", "pear"]

  >>> fruits[2]

  kiwi

  ```


  ### Indexing from the end


  We can also count backwards **from the end of the list** using negative
  numbers. Index `-1` indicates the last element, `-2` the second last, and so
  on:


  ```python

  >>> fruits = ["apple", "orange", "kiwi", "banana", "pear"]

  >>> fruits[-1]

  pear


  >>> fruits[-2]

  banana


  ```


  ### List slicing


  We can also give both **start** and **end** values, to retrieve a **list
  slice**. This behaves in the same way as **string slicing** (see Unit 3). Here
  is how that works:


  ```python

  >>> fruits = ["apple", "orange", "kiwi", "banana", "pear"]

  >>> fruits[0:2]

  ["apple", "orange"]


  >>> fruits[2:5]

  ['kiwi', 'banana', 'pear']


  ```


  If we leave either **start** or **end** value blank, Python will assume we
  mean the start or end of the list:


  ```python

  >>> fruits = ["apple", "orange", "kiwi", "banana", "pear"]

  >>> fruits[:2]

  ["apple", "orange"]


  >>> fruits[4:]

  ["pear"]


  ```


  We can use negative numbers in our slice too, here's how to chop off the final
  element:


  ```python

  >>> fruits[:-1]

  ['apple', 'orange', 'kiwi', 'banana']

  ```


  Now use the REPL on the right to practice list slicing, and answer the
  following questions.
