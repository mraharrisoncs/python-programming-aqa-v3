title: Creating and using lists
content: >
  ## Creating a list


  In Python, you can just assign a list to a variable like this:


  ```python

  temps = [24, 26, 31, 26, 21, 18, 22]

  ```


  Note that we use **square brackets** to indicate a list, and **elements** are
  separated by commas. 


  ## Lists can contain any data type


  Lists can contain integers, floats, strings or Booleans, or even other lists!
  Here are some more example list assignments


  ```python

  # create a list of weights for measuring ingredients - a mix of integers and
  floats

  weights = [1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20, 40]


  # create a list of fruits as strings

  fruits = ["apple", "orange", "kiwi", "banana", "pear"]


  # create a student record as a mix of strings, integers, floats and Booleans

  student = ["Taha", "Hussain", 10, "Pankhurst", 104, 93.5, False]


  # create a list of rooms in an adventure game. Each room is another list 

  # containing room number, description, object, doors and numbers of linked
  rooms

  rooms = [ [1, "Hall", "Mirror", "NESW", 2, 3, 4],
            [2, "Dining Room", "Candlestick", "ESW", 1, 5, 6] ]

  ```


  That last example might be used to store the configuration of a world in a
  text adventure! See Unit 8 for more on lists of lists. 


  ## List length


  The `len()` function returns the length of a list (the total number of
  elements).


  ```python

  >>> fruits = ["apple", "orange", "kiwi", "banana", "pear"]

  >>> len(fruits)

  5

  ```


  ## Accessing a list item


  We can access an item in a list by its **index number**, the position in the
  list, counting from 0:


  ```python

  >>> fruits = ["apple", "orange", "kiwi", "banana", "pear"]

  >>> fruits[0]

  apple


  >>> fruits[1]

  orange


  >>> student = ["Taha", "Hussain", 10, "Pankhurst", 104, 93.5, False]

  >>> student[5]

  93.5

  ```


  Now open the REPL and type in the above commands. Then try the questions
  below. 
showTerminal: true
questionGroups:
  - id: "1"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Which of the following is true about data types in a Python list?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Strings are not allowed in a Python list
            explanation: No, any data type can be included in a Python list.
          - id: "2"
            value: Booleans are not allowed in a Python list
            explanation: No, any data type can be included in a Python list.
          - id: "3"
            value: Only integers and floats are allowed in a Python list
            explanation: No, any data type can be included in a Python list.
          - id: "4"
            value: Any data type can be included in a Python list
            explanation: Yes, integers, floats, Booleans, strings and other lists!
            isCorrect: true
  - id: "2"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Which of the following is the correct way to create a list of integers
          in Python?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            explanation: This is the correct syntax for creating a list of integers using
              square brackets.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
            explanation: This creates something called a tuple, not a list, because it uses
              parentheses.
          - id: "3"
            value: numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
            explanation: This creates something called a set, not a list, because it uses
              curly braces.
          - id: "4"
            value: numbers = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
            explanation: This creates a tuple by default, not a list, because it lacks
              square brackets.
  - id: "3"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Using the list fruits = ["apple", "orange", "kiwi", "banana", "pear"],
          which command would display "kiwi"?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: fruits[2]
            explanation: Yes, 'kiwi' is at index 2 in the list.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: fruits[0]
            explanation: No, 'apple' is at index 0 in the list.
          - id: "3"
            value: fruits[1]
            explanation: No, 'orange' is at index 1 in the list (because we count from 0)
          - id: "4"
            value: fruits[3]
            explanation: No, 'banana' is at index 3 in the list (because we count from 0)
  - id: "4"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: string
        content: What is the index number used to access the first element of a list in
          Python?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "0"
            explanation: In Python, list indexing starts at 0.
