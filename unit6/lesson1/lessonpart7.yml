  ## 🚶‍♂️ **Question 1 – Simple Step Counter**


  Using the starter code in q1.py, create a program with a single function:


  * `total_steps(steps_list)`

    * Takes a list of daily step counts

    * Uses a **while loop** to add them up

    * Returns the total

  Your main program should create a list of step counts and print the total.

  ## 🍽️ Question 2 – Menu Ordering System


  Using the starter code in q2.py, write a program that:


  * Stores a list of valid menu items


  * Asks the user to choose an item


  * Validates the choice using a loop


  * Allows the user to add multiple valid items to their order


  * Stores the final order in a list and displays it


  Functions required:


  * `get_valid_item(menu)`


  * `take_order(menu)`

  ## 🎵 Question 3 – Music Playlist Manager


  Build a playlist program with these features:


  * `add_song(playlist, song)` → adds a song only if it isn’t already in the
  list


  * `remove_song(playlist, song)` → removes a song if it exists


  * `move_song(playlist, old_index, new_index)` → moves a song to a new position


  * `show_playlist(playlist)` → prints the playlist
