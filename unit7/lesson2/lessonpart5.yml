  # 🚆 **Capstone Project: Railway Journey Planner**


  In this project, you will write a Python program that answers the question:


  > **“How far can I travel in X minutes?”**


  In the starter program **journey\_planner.py** attached, you have:


  * a list of **station names**


  * a list of **journey times** between each pair of stations


  Your job is to write a function that:


  * starts at **station 0**


  * keeps adding journey times while there is still time left


  * saves the stations visited as it goes


  * stops when the next journey would take you over the limit


  * returns the final journey including stations visited, e.g. "Aldford through
  Bramley to Croxley".


  This project uses everything you’ve learned so far:


  * functions and return values


  * input, output and variables


  * lists and indexing


  * `while` loops and `for` loops


  * `if‑else`


  * string handling


  ***


  ## 🧱 **Example Data**


  ```python

  stations = ["Aldford", "Bramley", "Croxley", "Dunford", "Elmstead", "Fenton"]


  times = [3, 12, 8, 21, 11]

  ```


  This means:


  * Aldford → Bramley takes **3 minutes**


  * Bramley → Croxley takes **12 minutes**


  * Croxley → Dunford takes **8 minutes**


  * Dunford → Elmstead takes **21 minutes**


  * Elmstead → Fenton takes **11 minutes**


  ***


  ## 🎯 **Your Task**


  Write **two** functions. The **first** function:


  ```python

  max_station(minutes)

  ```


  returns the **index** of the last station you can reach within the given
  number of minutes.


  ### Example


  ```python

  >>> max_station(20)

  2

  ```


  Because:


  * 3 minutes → station 1


  * +12 minutes → station 2 (total 15)


  * +8 minutes → would be 23 → too far


  So the last reachable station is **station 2**.


  The **second** function:


  ```python

  journey_to(station)

  ```


  This function returns a string describing the journey from the first station
  up to the station number given, for example:


  ```python

  >>> journey_to(2)

  "Aldford through Bramley to Croxley."

  ```


  In the main program, ask the user for the number of minutes they have
  available. Then use your two functions to calculate the possible journey and
  output it. For example:


  ```

  Enter your available minutes:

  20

  In 20 minutes you can travel from Aldford through Bramley to Croxley.

  ```
