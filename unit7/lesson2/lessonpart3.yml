title: The accumulator pattern with 'for'
content: >
  The accumulator pattern is a common programming technique used to calculate a
  total or aggregate value by iterating over a sequence of data. In Python, this
  is often implemented using a `for` loop. Below are several examples
  demonstrating how to use the accumulator pattern with a `for` loop.


  ### Example 1: Sum of Numbers


  Let's calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using the accumulator pattern.


  ```python

  total = 0

  for number in range(1, 11):
      total += number
  print("The sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is:", total)

  ```


  In this example, `total` is initialized to 0. The `for` loop iterates over
  each number in the range from 1 to 10, adding each number to `total`.


  ### Example 2: Product of Numbers


  Now, let's calculate the product of numbers from 1 to 5. (The product is the
  result of **multiplying** numbers).


  ```python

  product = 1

  for number in range(1, 6):
      product *= number
  print("The product of numbers from 1 to 5 is:", product)

  ```


  Here, `product` is initialized to 1. The `for` loop multiplies each number in
  the range from 1 to 5 with `product`.


  ### Example 3: Sum of Even Numbers


  Let's find the sum of even numbers between 1 and 20.


  ```python

  sum_even = 0

  for number in range(1, 21):
      if number % 2 == 0:
          sum_even += number
  print("The sum of even numbers from 1 to 20 is:", sum_even)

  ```


  In this example, the `for` loop checks if a number is even using the modulus
  operator `%`. If the number is even, it is added to `sum_even`.


  ### Example 4: Accumulating Values from a List


  Suppose we have a list of numbers, and we want to calculate their total.


  ```python

  numbers = [3, 5, 7, 9, 11]

  total = 0

  for number in numbers:
      total += number
  print("The total of the list is:", total)

  ```


  Here, the `for` loop iterates over each element in the list `numbers`, adding
  each element to `total`.


  These examples illustrate how the accumulator pattern can be used in various
  scenarios to aggregate values using a `for` loop. Practice implementing this
  pattern to become proficient in solving problems that require accumulation.
