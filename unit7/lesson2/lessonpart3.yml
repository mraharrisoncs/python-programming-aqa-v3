title: The accumulator pattern with 'for'
content: >
  The **accumulator pattern** is a common programming technique used to
  calculate a total. We saw a `while` loop version earlier, now let's look at
  examples with a `for` loop.


  ### Example 1: Sum of Numbers


  Let's calculate the **sum** of numbers from 1 to 10 using the accumulator
  pattern.


  ```python

  total = 0

  for number in range(1, 11):
      total += number
  print("The sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is:", total)

  ```


  In this example, `total` is initialized to 0. The `for` loop iterates over
  each number in the range from 1 to 10, adding each number to `total`.


  > Tip: the symbol `+=` in Python is a shorthand way of saying *'add this to my
  variable'*. The line `total += number` is  actually short for `total = total +
  number`, in other words *'add the value of* *`number` to the variable*
  *`total.`'*


  ### Example 2: Product of Numbers


  Now, let's calculate the **product** of numbers from 1 to 5. (The product is
  the result of **multiplying** numbers).


  ```python

  product = 1

  for number in range(1, 6):
      product *= number
  print("The product of numbers from 1 to 5 is:", product)

  ```


  Here, `product` is initialized to 1. The `for` loop multiplies each number in
  the range from 1 to 5 with `product`.


  > Tip: we have used the shorthand again, this time to multiply our variable
  `product` by `number`. Just as before, `product *= number` is short for
  `product = product * number`


  ### Example 3: Sum of Even Numbers


  Let's find the sum of even numbers between 1 and 20.


  ```python

  sum_even = 0

  for number in range(1, 21):
      if number % 2 == 0:
          sum_even += number
  print("The sum of even numbers from 1 to 20 is:", sum_even)

  ```


  In this example, the `for` loop checks if a number is even using the modulus
  operator `%`. If the number is even, it is added to `sum_even`. (We could have
  used `range (2, 21, 2)` in our `for` loop instead, but this example might be
  useful for more complicated purposes!)


  ### Example 4: Accumulating Values from a List


  Instead of a simple range of numbers, we might have a list of numbers already,
  and we want to calculate their total.


  ```python

  numbers = [3, 8, 15, 9, 11]

  total = 0

  for number in numbers:
      total += number
  print("The total of the list is:", total)

  ```


  Here, the `for` loop iterates over each element in the list `numbers`, adding
  each element to `total`.

            value: When you need to calculate a total or product of a series of numbers.
            explanation: Yes, the accumulator pattern is used to calculate totals or
              products by iterating over a series of numbers.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: When you need to sort a list of numbers.
            explanation: No, sorting a list is not typically done using the accumulator
              pattern.
          - id: "3"
            value: When you need to find a value in a list.
            explanation: No, finding a value is not a use of the accumulator pattern.
          - id: "4"
            value: When you need to reverse a list.
            explanation: No, reversing a string is not related to the accumulator pattern.

          What is the output of this code? 
          product = 1 
          for number in range(1, 3): 
             product *= number 
          print(product)
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "2"
            explanation: Yes, the loop multiplies 1 by 1 and then by 2, resulting in 2.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "3"
            explanation: No, the loop does not include 3 in the range.
          - id: "3"
            value: "6"
            explanation: No, the loop only multiplies numbers 1 and 2.
          - id: "4"
            value: "1"
            explanation: No, the initial value is 1, but it is multiplied by the numbers in
              the range.
