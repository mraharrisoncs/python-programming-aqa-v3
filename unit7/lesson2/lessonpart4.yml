title: "Python practical: iterating over a range"
content: >+
  ### Worked Example 1: Sum of First N Natural Numbers


  In this example, we'll use a count-controlled loop to calculate the sum of the
  first N natural numbers. We'll define a function `sum_of_n_numbers` that takes
  an integer `n` as input and returns the sum.


  ```python

  def sum_of_n_numbers(n):
      total = 0
      for i in range(1, n + 1):
          total += i
      return total

  # Example usage

  n = 10

  print(f"The sum of the first {n} natural numbers is: {sum_of_n_numbers(n)}")

  ```


  ### Worked Example 2: Generating a Multiplication Table


  This example demonstrates how to generate a multiplication table for a given
  number using a count-controlled loop. We'll define a function
  `multiplication_table` that prints the table for a specified number up to a
  given range.


  ```python

  def multiplication_table(number, up_to):
      for i in range(1, up_to + 1):
          result = number * i
          print(f"{number} x {i} = {result}")

  # Example usage

  number = 5

  up_to = 10

  print(f"Multiplication table for {number}:")

  multiplication_table(number, up_to)

  ```


  ### Worked Example 3: Calculating Factorial


  In this example, we'll calculate the factorial of a number using a
  count-controlled loop. The function `factorial` will take an integer `n` and
  return its factorial.


  ```python

  def factorial(n):
      result = 1
      for i in range(1, n + 1):
          result *= i
      return result

  # Example usage

  n = 5

  print(f"The factorial of {n} is: {factorial(n)}")

  ```
