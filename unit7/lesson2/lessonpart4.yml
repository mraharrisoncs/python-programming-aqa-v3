  ### Worked Example 1: Sum of First N Natural Numbers


  In this example, we'll use a count-controlled loop to calculate the sum of the
  first N natural numbers. We'll define a function `sum_of_n_numbers` that takes
  an integer `n` as input and returns the sum.  


  ```python

  def sum_of_n_numbers(n):
      total = 0
      for i in range(1, n + 1):
          total += i
      return total

  # Example usage

  n = 10

  print(f"The sum of the first {n} natural numbers is: {sum_of_n_numbers(n)}")

  ```

  ### Worked Example 2: Calculating Factorial


  In this example, we'll calculate the factorial of a number using a
  count-controlled loop. The function `factorial` will take an integer `n` and
  return its factorial.


  ```python

  def factorial(n):
      result = 1
      for i in range(1, n + 1):
          result *= i
      return result

  # Example usage

  n = 5

  print(f"The factorial of {n} is: {factorial(n)}")

  ```

  ## Question 1: Count Multiples of 3


  Using **q1.py**, write a function that counts how many numbers between 1 and
  `n` are **multiples of 3**. 


  > Hint, use `%` (modulo) to find the remainder.


  ***


  ## Question 2: Visual Countdown


  In **q2.py**, write a function that takes two parameters: a string, and a
  number `n` , and counts down from n to zero, displaying a 'bar' of **n**
  strings for each number.


  > Hint: We can 'multiply' a string by an integer `x`, it concatenates the
  string `x ` times. For example, `char * x` will create a string made up of x
  copies of `char`.


  For example, the output for countdown ("@", 3) should be:
