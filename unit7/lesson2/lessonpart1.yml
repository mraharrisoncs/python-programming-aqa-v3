title: The Python range() function
content: >
  ## Using `range()` to Create a Loop


  The `range()` function is useful for generating a sequence of numbers, which
  can be used to control the iteration in a `for` loop. You can specify the
  start, stop, and step values. Here is an example that mimics a `FOR i = a TO b
  STEP c` loop:


  ```python

  for i in range(0, 10, 2):
      print(i)
  ```


  In this example, `range(0, 10, 2)` generates numbers starting from 0 up to
  (but not including) 10, with a step of 2. The loop will print: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.
