title: Iterating over a literal list of numbers
content: >
  Sometimes we want to do something a set number of times, or perform an
  operation on each number in a range of numbers. Let's look at some loops that
  iterate over a **range of numbers.**


  ### Times table program


  Remember our times table program that used a `while` loop in Unit 5?


  ```python

  def five_times_table():
    # five times table
    counter = 1
    while counter < 11:
      print(f"5 x {counter} = {5 * counter}")
      counter += 1

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  five_times_table()

  ```


  We can improve this by using a `for` loop, that **iterates** over a **range of
  numbers** stored in a **list literal** instead of using a counter variable and
  incrementing it ourselves:


  ```python

  def five_times_table():
    # five times table
    for counter in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]:
      print(f"5 x {counter} = {5 * counter}")

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  five_times_table()

  ```


  **Explanation:**


  * The `for` loop **iterates** over the list `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]`, which
  means it sets the `counter` variable to each number in turn, then executes the
  indented code block.


  * The first time through the loop, `counter` = 1, and the line `5 x 1 = 5` is
  printed


  * The second time through the loop, `counter` = 2, and the line `5 x 2 =
  10` is printed


  * The loop continues until it prints `5 x 10 = 50`, after which there are no
  more elements in the list so the loop ends.




  ### Countdown program


  Here's another example from Unit 5:


  ```python

  def countdown():
    # count down from 10
    counter = 10
    while counter >= 1:
      print(f"{counter} !")
      counter -= 1
    print("lift-off !")

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  countdown()

  ```


  Again we can improve this with a `for` loop and a list of numbers, this time
  counting down from ten:


  ```python

  def countdown():
    # count down from 10
    for counter in [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]:
      print(f"{counter} !")
      counter -= 1
    print("lift-off !")

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  countdown()

  ```

          How many times will this loop iterate? 
          for counter in [10,9,8,7,6]:
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: 5 times
            explanation: Yes, the loop iterates once for each element in the list, which has
              5 elements.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: 6 times
            explanation: No, the list contains 5 elements, so the loop iterates 5 times.
          - id: "3"
            value: 4 times
            explanation: No, the list contains 5 elements, so the loop iterates 5 times.
          - id: "4"
            value: 10 times
            explanation: No, the list contains 5 elements, so the loop iterates 5 times.

        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "10"
            explanation: Yes, the loop iterates once for each element in the list, which has
              10 elements.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "9"
            explanation: No, the loop iterates over all 10 elements in the list.
          - id: "3"
            value: "11"
            explanation: No, the list contains only 10 elements, so the loop iterates 10
              times.
          - id: "4"
            value: "5"
            explanation: No, the loop iterates over each of the 10 elements in the list.

          Which of these for statements would behave like this while loop? 
          counter = 1 
          while counter \< 6: 
              # body of loop 
              counter += 2
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "for counter in [1, 3, 5]:"
            explanation: Yes, this for loop iterates from 1 to 5 with a step of 2, matching
              the while loop's behavior.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "for counter in  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:"
            explanation: No, the while loop increments the counter by 2 each time
          - id: "3"
            value: "for counter in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:"
            explanation: No, this for loop starts at 0 and doesn't increment in 2s
          - id: "4"
            value: "for counter in [1, 3, 5, 7]:"
            explanation: No, this for loop continues to 7, when the while loop would stop
              after 5
