title: Count-controlled iteration with range()
content: >
  On the previous page, we supplied the `for` statement with a **literal list**
  of numbers each time. This would become messy for long lists of numbers!


  ### Using range() to generate the list of numbers


  Instead we can use the `range()` function to create a list of numbers, and
  then **iterate** over this.   


  ```python

  def five_times_table():
    # five times table
    for counter in range(1, 11):
      print(f"5 x {counter} = {5 * counter}")

  # MAIN PROGRAM 

  five_times_table()

  ```


  \*\*Explanation: \*\*


  The function `range(1,11)` makes a range of numbers from 1 to 10 (not
  including 11), which creates the list `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]` on our behalf!
  We then use this in the `for` statement just like before. 


  Try this now in the attached program `five_times_table_range.py` and try
  changing the range values:


  * Print the table up to `5 x 20 = 100`


  * Start at `5 x 5 = 25` and end at `5 x 15 = 75` 


  ## Syntax of range()


  `range()` takes up to three parameters: `start`, `stop`, and `step`. 


  ```python

  range(start, stop, step)

  ```


  * `start` - the starting integer. An optional parameter, 0 is assumed if you
  skip it.


  * `stop` - the integer to stop at - **not included** - you must always specify
  this value.


  * `step` - the interval between values in the range. An optional parameter,
  and 1 is assumed if you skip it.


  ### Example ranges


  ```python

  range(1, 11, 1)   → [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]


  range(10)         → [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]


  range(10)         → [0,1,2,3,4]


  range(10, 0, -1)  → [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]


  range(2, 10, 2)   → [2, 4, 6, 8]

  ```


  ### Example 1: stop only, generating numbers from zero


  ```python

  for i in range(5):
      print(i)

  # outputs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 on separate lines

  ```


  This loop will print numbers from 0 to 4. Here, `range(5)` generates numbers
  starting from 0 up to, but not including, 5.


  ### Example 2: start and stop


  ```python

  for i in range(2, 6):
      print(i)
  ```


  This loop will print numbers from 2 to 5. The `range(2, 6)` starts at 2 and
  stops before 6.


  ### Example 3: start, stop and step


  ```python

  for i in range(0, 10, 2):
      print(i)
  ```


  This loop will print even numbers from 0 to 8. The `range(0, 10, 2)` starts at
  0, stops before 10, and increments by 2.


  ### Example 4: Going backwards with negative step


  ```python

  for i in range(5, 0, -1):
      print(i)
  ```


  This loop will print numbers from 5 to 1. The `range(5, 0, -1)` starts at 5
  and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1.


  ### Our times table program again


  Here is our times table program.


  ```python

  def five_times_table():
    # five times table
    for counter in range(1,11):
      print(f"5 x {counter} = {5 * counter}")

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  five_times_table()

  ```


  ### Countdown revisited!


  Again we can use `range` to do the heavy lifting for us in our countdown
  program, this time we need to give the `range()` function a `step` of `-1`: 


  ```python

  def countdown():
    # count down from 10
    for counter in range(10, 0, -1):
      print(f"{counter} !")
      counter -= 1
    print("lift-off !")

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  countdown()

  ```
