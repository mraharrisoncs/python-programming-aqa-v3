title: Count-controlled iteration with range()
content: >
  In Python, a `for` loop can be used to iterate over a sequence of numbers
  generated by the `range()` function. This is known as count-controlled
  iteration, where the loop runs a specific number of times.


  ### Basic Syntax of `for` Loop with `range()`


  The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers, which can be used in a
  `for` loop to control the number of iterations. The basic syntax is:


  ```python

  for i in range(start, stop, step):
      # Code to execute in each iteration
  ```


  * **start**: The starting number of the sequence (inclusive).


  * **stop**: The end number of the sequence (exclusive).


  * **step**: The difference between each number in the sequence.


  ### Example 1: Iterating from 0 to 4


  ```python

  for i in range(5):
      print(i)
  ```


  This loop will print numbers from 0 to 4. Here, `range(5)` generates numbers
  starting from 0 up to, but not including, 5.


  ### Example 2: Specifying a Start and Stop


  ```python

  for i in range(2, 6):
      print(i)
  ```


  This loop will print numbers from 2 to 5. The `range(2, 6)` starts at 2 and
  stops before 6.


  ### Example 3: Using a Step Value


  ```python

  for i in range(0, 10, 2):
      print(i)
  ```


  This loop will print even numbers from 0 to 8. The `range(0, 10, 2)` starts at
  0, stops before 10, and increments by 2.


  ### Example 4: Iterating Backwards


  ```python

  for i in range(5, 0, -1):
      print(i)
  ```


  This loop will print numbers from 5 to 1. The `range(5, 0, -1)` starts at 5
  and decrements by 1 until it reaches 1.


  ### Practical Use Case: Sum of Numbers


  You can use a `for` loop with `range()` to calculate the sum of numbers:


  ```python

  total = 0

  for i in range(1, 6):
      total += i
  print("Sum:", total)

  ```


  This code calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 5, resulting in a total of
  15.


  By using `range()` in a `for` loop, you can efficiently control the number of
  iterations and perform operations on sequences of numbers. Practice using
  different parameters in `range()` to become comfortable with count-controlled
  iteration in Python.
