title: Why count-controlled iteration?
content: >+
  Count-controlled iteration, also known as **definite** iteration, repeats a
  block of code a specific number of times. This type of iteration is useful
  when the number of iterations is **known before the loop starts**. In Python,
  we use a `for` loop for definite iteration.


  ### When to use a for loop


  We use a **for** loop when we know how many times we want to repeat a block of
  code. We might want to run a **set number of times** or process a **known list
  of items.** This is why we call it **definite** iteration, the loop will run a
  definite number of iterations.


  > Remember, if we do **not know** how many times we want to loop, we would use
  **indefinite** iteration, also known as **condition-controlled** iteration. In
  Python this means a **while** loop which we met in Unit 5.


  ### Structure of a `for` Loop


  The basic structure of a `for` loop in Python is as follows:


  ```python

  for variable in sequence:
      # Code block to execute
  ```


  * **`variable`**: This is a temporary variable that takes the value of the
  next item in the sequence on each iteration.


  * **`sequence`**: This is the collection of items you want to iterate over.
  Usually this is a list **literal** or list **variable.**


  * **Code block**: This is the block of code that will be executed on each
  iteration. It is indented to show that it belongs to the loop.


  ### Example for loop


  Here is a simple example of a `for` loop iterating over a list:


  ```python

  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

  for fruit in fruits:
      print(fruit)
  ```


  * **Iterating over a sequence of numbers**: You might want to perform an
  action a fixed number of times, such as printing numbers from 1 to 10.


  * **Processing items in a list**: You can iterate over each item in a **list**
  to perform operations like summing values or modifying elements.
