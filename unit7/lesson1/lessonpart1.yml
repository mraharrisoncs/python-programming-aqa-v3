title: Why count-controlled iteration?
content: >+
  Count-controlled iteration, also known as **definite** iteration, repeats a
  block of code a specific number of times. This type of iteration is useful
  when the number of iterations is **known before the loop starts**. In Python,
  we use a `for` loop for definite iteration.


  ### When to use a for loop


  We use a **for** loop when we know how many times we want to repeat a block of
  code. We might want to run a **set number of times** or process a **known list
  of items.** This is why we call it **definite** iteration, the loop will run a
  definite number of iterations.


  > Remember, if we do **not know** how many times we want to loop, we would use
  **indefinite** iteration, also known as **condition-controlled** iteration. In
  Python this means a **while** loop which we met in Unit 5.


  ### For loop syntax

  ### Example uses


  Remember the countdown program we made with a while loop?


  ```python

  def countdown():
    # count down from 10
    counter = 10
    while counter >= 1:
      print(f"{counter} !")
      counter -= 1
    print("lift-off !")

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  countdown()

  ```


  We can simplify this 


  * **Iterating over a sequence of numbers**: You might want to perform an
  action a fixed number of times, such as printing numbers from 1 to 10.


  * **Processing items in a list**: You can iterate over each item in a **list**
  to perform operations like summing values or modifying elements.
