title: Why count-controlled iteration?
content: >+
  Count-controlled iteration, also known as **definite** iteration, repeats a
  block of code a specific number of times. This type of iteration is useful
  when the number of iterations is **known before the loop starts**. In Python,
  we use a `for` loop for definite iteration.


  ### When to use a for loop


  We use a **for** loop when we know how many times we want to repeat a block of
  code. We might want to run a **set number of times** or process a **known list
  of items.** This is why we call it **definite** iteration, the loop will run a
  definite number of iterations.


  > Remember, if we do **not know** how many times we want to loop, we would use
  **indefinite** iteration, also known as **condition-controlled** iteration. In
  Python this means a **while** loop which we met in Unit 5.


  ### Structure of a `for` Loop


  The basic structure of a `for` loop in Python is as follows:


  ```python

  for variable in sequence:
      # Code block to execute
  ```


  * **`variable`**: This is a temporary variable that takes the value of the
  next item in the sequence on each iteration.


  * **`sequence`**: This is the collection of items you want to iterate over.
  Usually this is a list **literal** or list **variable.**


  * **Code block**: This is the block of code that will be executed on each
  iteration. It is indented to show that it belongs to the loop.


  ### Example for loop


  Here is a simple example of a `for` loop iterating over a list:


  ```python

  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

  for fruit in fruits:
      print(fruit)
  ```


  ```

  apple

  banana

  cherry

  ```


  ### Uses of a for loop


  * **Iterating over a sequence of numbers**: You might want to perform an
  action a fixed number of times, such as

    * displaying a times table for a given number

    * allowing a finite number of password attempts

  * **Processing items in a list**: You can iterate over each item in a **list**
  to perform operations like:

    * calculating the sum or average of a list of numbers

    * searching or sorting a list of data 

    * modifying every element in a list such as adding 10% for inflation!

  ### Definite versus indefinite


  Here is a reminder of when to use definite iteration (e.g. `for`) and when to
  use indefinite iteration (e.g. `while`):


  | Definite iteration                                  | Indefinite
  iteration                                  |        |

  | Also known as count-controlled iteration            | Also known as
  condition-controlled iteration.         |        |

  | Iterates over a list or a range of numbers.         | Loops until a
  condition is met or becomes unmet.      |        |

  | Runs a fixed number of times                        | Number of iterations
  is unknown on entry to the loop  | <br /> |

  | **Use cases**                                       | **Use
  cases**                                         |        |

  | Performing an action a set number of times.         | Continuously checking
  for a condition to become true. |        |

  | Input validation with a fixed number of attempts.   | Waiting for user input
  to match a specific condition. |        |

  | Sorting a list of known length.                     | Monitoring a sensor
  until a threshold is reached.     |        |

  | Updating a list with a 20% reduction for each item. | Repeatedly prompting
  for correct input until valid.   |        |
