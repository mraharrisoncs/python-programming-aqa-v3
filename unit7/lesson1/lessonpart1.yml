title: Why count-controlled iteration?
content: >+
  Count-controlled iteration, also known as **definite** iteration, repeats a
  block of code a specific number of times. This type of iteration is useful
  when the number of iterations is known before the loop starts. In Python, we
  use a `for` loop.


  ### When to use a for loop


  * **Iterating over a sequence of numbers**: You might want to perform an
  action a fixed number of times, such as printing numbers from 1 to 10.


  * **Processing items in a list**: You can iterate over each item in a **list**
  to perform operations like summing values or modifying elements.


  ### Example Code in Python


  ```python

  # Example 1: Iterating over a range of numbers

  for i in range(1, 11):
      print(i)

  # Example 2: Iterating over a list

  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

  for fruit in fruits:
      print(fruit)

  # Example 3: Using range() to iterate with a counter

  total = 0

  for i in range(5):
      total += i
  print("Total:", total)

  ```
