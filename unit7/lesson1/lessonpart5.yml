title: "Python practical: iterating over a list"
content: >+
  Here are three examples of simple programs that iterate over lists:


  ### Example 1: Sum of Numbers in a List


  ```python

  def sum_of_numbers(numbers):
      total = 0
      for number in numbers:
          total += number
      return total

  # Example use

  numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]

  print("Sum of numbers:", sum_of_numbers(numbers))

  ```


  ### Explanation


  * The function `sum_of_numbers` takes a list of numbers as its parameter.


  * It initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will hold the sum of the
  numbers.


  * The `for` loop iterates over each `number` in the `numbers` list.


  * During each iteration, the current `number` is added to `total`.


  * After the loop completes, the function returns the `total` sum of the
  numbers.


  * The example use demonstrates calling the function with a list `[5, 10, 15,
  20]` and printing the result.


  ### Example 2: Make Words Uppercase in a List


  ```python

  def make_uppercase(words):
      upper_words = []
      for word in words:
          upper_words.append(word.upper())
      return upper_words

  # Example use

  words = ["python", "loop", "iteration", "code"]

  print("Uppercase words:", make_uppercase(words))

  ```


  ### Explanation


  * The function `make_uppercase` takes a list of words as its parameter.


  * It initializes an empty list `upper_words` to store the uppercase versions
  of the words.


  * The `for` loop iterates over each `word` in the `words` list.


  * During each iteration, the `word.upper()` method is called to convert the
  word to uppercase, and the result is appended to `upper_words`.


  * After the loop completes, the function returns the list `upper_words`
  containing all the uppercase words.


  * The example use demonstrates calling the function with a list `["python",
  "loop", "iteration", "code"]` and printing the result.


  ### Example 3: Filter Even Numbers from a List


  ```python

  def filter_even_numbers(numbers):
      even_numbers = []
      for number in numbers:
          if number % 2 == 0:
              even_numbers.append(number)
      return even_numbers

  # Example use

  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

  print("Even numbers:", filter_even_numbers(numbers))

  ```


  ### Explanation


  * The function `filter_even_numbers` takes a list of numbers as its parameter.


  * It initializes an empty list `even_numbers` to store the even numbers.


  * The `for` loop iterates over each `number` in the `numbers` list.


  * During each iteration, it checks if the `number` is even by using the
  condition `number % 2 == 0`.


  * If the condition is true, the `number` is appended to the `even_numbers`
  list.


  * After the loop completes, the function returns the list `even_numbers`
  containing all the even numbers.


  * The example use demonstrates calling the function with a list `[1, 2, 3, 4,
  5, 6]` and printing the result.
