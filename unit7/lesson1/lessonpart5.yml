title: "Python practical: iterating over a list"
content: >+
  Let's look at some examples of simple programs that iterate over lists, then
  you can write your own!


  ### Example 1: Sum of Numbers in a List


  ```python

  def sum_of_numbers(numbers):
      total = 0
      for number in numbers:
          total += number
      return total

  # Example use

  numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]

  print("Sum of numbers:", sum_of_numbers(numbers))

  ```


  ### Explanation


  * The function `sum_of_numbers` takes a list of numbers as its parameter.


  * It initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will hold the sum of the
  numbers.


  * The `for` loop iterates over each `number` in the `numbers` list.


  * During each iteration, the current `number` is added to `total`.


  * After the loop completes, the function returns the `total` sum of the
  numbers.


  * The example use demonstrates calling the function with a list `[5, 10, 15,
  20]` and printing the result.

  ### Example 2: Make Words Uppercase in a List


  ```python

  def make_uppercase(words):
      upper_words = []
      for word in words:
          upper_words.append(word.upper())
      return upper_words

  # Example use

  words = ["python", "loop", "iteration", "code"]

  print("Uppercase words:", make_uppercase(words))

  ```


  ### Explanation


  * The function `make_uppercase` takes a list of words as its parameter.


  * It initializes an empty list `upper_words` to store the uppercase versions
  of the words.


  * The `for` loop iterates over each `word` in the `words` list.


  * During each iteration, the `word.upper()` method is called to convert the
  word to uppercase, and the result is appended to `upper_words`.


  * After the loop completes, the function returns the list `upper_words`
  containing all the uppercase words.


  * The example use demonstrates calling the function with a list `["python",
  "loop", "iteration", "code"]` and printing the result.

  ### Question 1: Filter Even Numbers from a List


  Open file **q1.py** and complete the function to filter even numbers from a
  list.  The function should&#x20;


  * take a list of numbers as a parameter


  * return another list made up of just the even numbers in the original list.


  ***


  ### Question 2: Count vowels in a string


  Open file **q2.py** and complete the function to count the vowels in a given
  string.  The function should&#x20;


  * take a string parameter


  * return an integer which is the number of vowels in the string. Vowels are
  'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'.
