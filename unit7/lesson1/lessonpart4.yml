title: Iterating over a string

  ## Iterating Over a String


  We met this technique briefly in Unit 3. A `for` loop can also be used to
  iterate over each character in a string. Here is an example:


  ```python

  word = "hello"

  for letter in word:
      print(letter)
  ```


  This loop will print each character in the string `word`.

  ### A Simple Caesar Cipher


  A **Caesar cipher** is one of the oldest and simplest ways to encode a
  message. It works by **shifting each letter** forward in the alphabet by a
  fixed number of places. Because a string is just a sequence of characters, a
  `for` loop is perfect for processing each one.


  ### Caesar Cipher Encoder Function


  ```python

  def caesar_encode(message, shift):
      alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
      result = ""

      for char in message:
          if char in alphabet:
              position = alphabet.index(char)
              new_position = (position + shift) % 26
              result += alphabet[new_position]
          else:
              result += char

      return result

  # Example use

  print(caesar_encode("hello world", 3))

  ```


  ### Explanation


  * **`alphabet`** is a simple string containing all lowercase letters.


  * The loop processes the message **one character at a time**.


  * If the character is a letter:

    * `.index(char)` finds its position in the alphabet.

    * `(position + shift) % 26` moves it forward and wraps around if needed.

    * The new shifted letter is added to the result.

  * If the character is **not** a letter (space, punctuation), it is copied
  unchanged.


  * The function returns the encoded message so it can be reused anywhere.


  ### Example output


  ```

  khoor zruog

  ```


  This is `"hello world"` shifted by 3 places. Try the code now in the attached
  file.

        content: If a string is stored in the variable 'passcode', what is the correct
          syntax to iterate over this string?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "for char in passcode:"
            explanation: Yes, this syntax correctly iterates over each character in the
              string 'passcode'.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "for passcode in char:"
            explanation: No, this syntax is incorrect because 'passcode' should be the
              iterable, not the loop variable.
          - id: "3"
            value: "while char in passcode:"
            explanation: No, a 'while' loop is not used for iterating over each character in
              a string.
          - id: "4"
            value: "for each char in passcode:"
            explanation: No, Python does not use 'each' in the 'for' loop syntax.

          is being performed by '%'?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Modulo operation
            explanation: Yes, the '%' operator performs the modulo operation, which gives
              the remainder of a division.

            value: Addition
            explanation: No, addition is performed by the '+' operator, not '%'.
          - id: "3"
            value: Subtraction
            explanation: No, subtraction is performed by the '-' operator, not '%'.

            value: Division
            explanation: No, division is performed by the '/' operator, not '%'.
