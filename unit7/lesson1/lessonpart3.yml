title: More iteration over lists
content: >+
  So far, we’ve iterated over simple lists of strings such as fruit names.
  Python lists, however, can store **any kind of data**: numbers, strings, or
  even a mixture. A `for` loop works the same way no matter what the list
  contains.


  ## Processing a list of numbers


  Lists often contain **numeric data**, such as prices, temperatures, or
  measurements. A `for` loop lets us process each number in turn.


  ### Example 1: Increasing prices by 10%


  ```python

  prices = [1.20, 2.50, 3.99, 0.99]


  for price in prices:
      new_price = price * 1.10
      print("New price:", round(new_price, 2))
  ```


  ### Explanation


  * Each `price` is a **float** (a number with decimals).


  * The loop multiplies each price by `1.10` to add 10%.


  * `round(..., 2)` keeps the output tidy to two decimal places.


  ***


  ### Example 2: Iterating Over a List of Strings


  You’ve already seen this with fruits, but here’s a different example that
  *uses* the string data rather than just printing it.


  ```python

  def word_lengths(words):
      for word in words:
          length = len(word)
          print(word, "has", length, "letters")

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  word_lengths(["python", "loop", "iteration", "code"])

  ```


  ### Explanation


  * The `word_lengths()` function takes one parameter, a list called `words`.


  * The `for` loop iterates over the list of words, assigning each word to the
  variable `word` in turn.


  * Inside the loop, we calculate the length of the word, and output this in a
  message.


  * In the main program we call the function with a list of words.

  ## PRIMM Activities


  Using the attached **`test_steps.py`**:


  1. 🤔 **Predict**
     What do you think the program will output for each day?
  2. ▶️ **Run**
     Run the program and compare the actual output with your prediction.
  3. 🔍 **Investigate**

     * What is the **loop variable** in the `for` loop, and what is its **data type**?

     * Why does the program use `range(len(steps))` instead of `for s in steps`?

     * What happens if the goal is set higher than all the values in the list?
  4. ✏️ **Modify**
     Change the program so it also prints the **actual step count** next to each day.
  5. 🛠️ **Make**
     Open **temps.py** and write a new program that processes temperatures. Finish the functions given, to display all temperatures, and to count the days above a given threshold.
