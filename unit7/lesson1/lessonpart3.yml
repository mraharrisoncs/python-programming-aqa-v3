  ## More iteration over lists


  In Python, a `for` loop is commonly used to iterate over elements in a list.
  This allows you to perform operations on each item in the list. Here is a
  simple example:


  ```python

  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

  for fruit in fruits:
      print(fruit)
  ```


  In this example, the loop iterates over each element in the `fruits` list and
  prints it.
