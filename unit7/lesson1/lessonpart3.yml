title: More iteration over lists
content: >
  ***


  So far, we’ve iterated over simple lists of strings such as fruit names.
  Python lists, however, can store **any kind of data** — numbers, strings, or
  even a mixture. A `for` loop works the same way no matter what the list
  contains.


  ## Iterating Over a List of Numbers (Floats)


  Lists often contain **numeric data**, such as prices, temperatures, or
  measurements. A `for` loop lets us process each number in turn.


  ### Example: Increasing prices by 10%


  ```python

  prices = [1.20, 2.50, 3.99, 0.99]


  for price in prices:
      new_price = price * 1.10
      print("New price:", round(new_price, 2))
  ```


  ### Explanation


  * Each `price` is a **float** (a number with decimals).


  * The loop multiplies each price by `1.10` to add 10%.


  * `round(..., 2)` keeps the output tidy to two decimal places.

  ## Iterating Over a List of Strings


  You’ve already seen this with fruits, but here’s a different example that
  *uses* the string data rather than just printing it.


  ### Example: Counting the length of each word


  ```python

  words = ["python", "loop", "iteration", "code"]


  for word in words:
      length = len(word)
      print(word, "has", length, "letters")
  ```


  ## Iterating Over a Mixed List


  Python lists can contain **different data types at the same time**. This is
  unusual in some languages, but perfectly normal in Python.


  ### Example: Identifying the type of each item


  ```python

  items = ["apple", 3.14, 42, "banana", True]


  for item in items:
      print(item, "is a", type(item))
  ```


  ### What this shows


  * The loop doesn’t care what type each element is.


  * `type(item)` reveals whether it’s a string, float, integer, or boolean.


  * This is useful when processing unpredictable or user‑generated data.

  ## Using a Loop to Build a New List


  A common pattern is to iterate over a list and create a **new** list based on
  the original.


  ### Example: Converting temperatures from °C to °F


  ```python

  temps_c = [0, 10, 20, 30]

  temps_f = []


  for c in temps_c:
      f = (c * 9/5) + 32
      temps_f.append(f)

  print(temps_f)

  ```


  ### Why this matters


  This pattern — *loop → calculate → append* — is the foundation of many
  data‑processing tasks.
