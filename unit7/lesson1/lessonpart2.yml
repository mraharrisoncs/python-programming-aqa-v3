title: Iterating over a list
content: >+
  In Python, a `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence, such as a list or
  string.&#x20;


  ### Structure of a `for` Loop


  The basic structure of a `for` loop in Python is as follows:


  ```python

  for variable in sequence:
      # Code block to execute
  ```


  * **`variable`**: This is a temporary variable that takes the value of the
  next item in the sequence on each iteration.


  * **`sequence`**: This is the collection of items you want to iterate over.


  * **Code block**: This is the block of code that will be executed on each
  iteration. It is indented to indicate that it belongs to the loop.


  ### Example for loop


  Here is a simple example of a `for` loop iterating over a list:


  ```python

  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

  for fruit in fruits:
      print(fruit)
  ```


  In this example, the loop will print each fruit in the list one by one.
