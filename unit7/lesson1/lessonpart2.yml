title: Iterating over a list
content: >
  In Python, a `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence, such as a list or
  string.


  ## Printing ALL THE FRUITS!


  Here is that fruits example again:


  ```python

  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

  for fruit in fruits:
      print(fruit)
  ```


  ```

  apple

  banana

  cherry

  ```


  ### Explanation


  * The list `fruits` contains three elements: "apple", "banana", and "cherry".


  * The `for` loop iterates over each element in the `fruits` list.


  * During each iteration, the variable `fruit` takes on the value of the
  current element in the list


  * In the first iteration, `fruit` is assigned the value `"apple"`


  * The `print(fruit)` statement outputs the current value of `fruit` to the
  console.


  * When the code loops around, `fruit` is now assigned the value `"banana"` and
  so on.


  * As a result, each fruit in the list is printed on a new line.


  ## More than just printing


  We can perform a whole bunch of things inside the loop, not just printing.
  Here is an improved program that outputs a message along with each fruit,
  using the correct article (*a* or *an*) in front of our fruit, using a string
  of vowels.


  > Tip: in English, the basic *articles* are the words `a` ,`an` and
  `the`.&#x20;


  ```python

  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "damson", "elderberry"]

  for fruit in fruits:
      if fruit[0] in "aeiou":
          article = "an "
      else:
          article = "a "
      print("I love " + article + fruit)

  ```


  You can try this code in the attached file **`fruits_article.py`**.
