title: More traversing - processing numbers

  Let's look at some more examples of using nested `for` loops to manipulate 2D
  arrays (lists of lists).


  ### Increasing Brightness of a Bitmap


  Let's create a 6x6 list of lists containing float values from 0 to 9.9,
  representing a grayscale bitmap, where the value is the brightness of a pixel.
  We will then increase the brightness of all pixels by 10%.


  ```python

  # Creating a 6x6 bitmap with float values

  bitmap = [
      [0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5],
      [6.6, 7.7, 8.8, 9.9, 0.0, 1.1],
      [2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.6, 7.7],
      [8.8, 9.9, 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.3],
      [4.4, 5.5, 6.6, 7.7, 8.8, 9.9],
      [0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5]
  ]


  # Function to increase brightness by 10%

  def increase_brightness(bitmap):
      for i in range(len(bitmap)):
          for j in range(len(bitmap[i])):
              bitmap[i][j] *= 1.1

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  increase_brightness(bitmap)


  print("Bitmap with increased brightness:")

  for row in bitmap:
      print(row)
  ```


  In this code, the `increase_brightness` function multiplies each pixel value
  by 1.1, effectively increasing the brightness by 10%.
