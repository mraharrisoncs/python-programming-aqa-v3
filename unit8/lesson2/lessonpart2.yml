title: More traversing - processing numbers

  Let's look at some more examples of using nested `for` loops to manipulate 2D
  arrays (lists of lists).


  ### Increasing Brightness of a Bitmap


  Let's create a 6x6 list of lists containing float values from 0 to 9.9,
  representing a grayscale bitmap, where the value is the brightness of a pixel.
  We will then increase the brightness of all pixels by 10%.


  ```python

  # Creating a 6x6 bitmap with float values

  bitmap = [
      [0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5],
      [6.6, 7.7, 8.8, 9.9, 0.0, 1.1],
      [2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5, 6.6, 7.7],
      [8.8, 9.9, 0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.3],
      [4.4, 5.5, 6.6, 7.7, 8.8, 9.9],
      [0.0, 1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5]
  ]


  # Function to increase brightness by 10%

  def increase_brightness(bitmap):
      for i in range(len(bitmap)):
          for j in range(len(bitmap[i])):
              bitmap[i][j] *= 1.1

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  increase_brightness(bitmap)


  print("Bitmap with increased brightness:")

  for row in bitmap:
      print(row)
  ```


  In this code, the `increase_brightness` function multiplies each pixel value
  by 1.1, effectively increasing the brightness by 10%.

  ## PRIMM Activities


  Take a look at this program:


  ```python

  # A 2D list where each row represents a student

  # and each column represents a test score out of 100.

  scores = [
      [55, 72, 88, 90],
      [40, 65, 70, 75],
      [95, 98, 92, 88],
      [60, 58, 62, 64]
  ]


  # Increase all scores by 5% (capped at 100)

  def boost_scores(scores):
      for i in range(len(scores)):
          for j in range(len(scores[i])):
              new_value = scores[i][j] * 1.05
              if new_value > 100:
                  new_value = 100
              scores[i][j] = new_value

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  boost_scores(scores)


  print("Boosted scores:")

  for row in scores:
      print(row)
  ```


  Using the attached **`boost_scores.py`**:


  1. 🤔 **Predict**\
     What do you think will happen to the highest scores after the boost?\
     Will any values go above 100?

  2. ▶️ **Run**\
     Run the program and compare the actual output with your prediction.

  3. 🔍 **Investigate**

     * What does `scores[i][j]` refer to in the nested loop?

     * Why does the program need **two** `for` loops to update every score?

     * What is the purpose of the line `if new_value > 100:`?

  4. ✏️ **Modify**\
     Change the program so it boosts scores by **10%** instead of 5%, and prints each score **before and after** boosting.

  5. 🛠️ **Make**\
     Open **high\_scores.py** and write a new function that counts how many scores in the 2D list are **greater than or equal to** a given threshold. Test it with thresholds of 70, 80 and 90.

          What does scores[i][j] refer to in the nested loop?

          Why does the program need two for loops to update every score? How did
          you get on with the Modify and Make activities?
