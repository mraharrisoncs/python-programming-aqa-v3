title: Python practical - 2D array exercises
content: >+
  Now try these three exercises that use 2D arrays (lists of lists) in Python.


  ## Question 1: Print the First Column of a 2D Array


  In **q1.py**, you will see a 2D list called `temperatures` containing **three
  weeks** of daily temperatures, like this:


  ```python

  temperatures = [
      [24, 26, 31, 26, 21, 18, 22],
      [30, 32, 33, 31, 29, 28, 27],
      [20, 22, 25, 23, 21, 19, 18]
  ]

  ```


  Write a function called `print_first_column(data)` which should print the
  **first value of each row**, one per line, like this:


  ```

  24

  30

  20

  ```


  Add more rows to the data, and ensure your code works for any size 2D array.

  ## Question 2: Display all students in a House


  In **q2.py**, you will see a 2D list called `students`, as follows:


  ```python

  # first name, surname, year group, house, form, score, EAL status

  students = [
      ["Taha",     "Hussain",   10, "Pankhurst",   104, 93.5,  False],
      ["Aisha",    "Khan",       9, "Nightingale",  91, 88.0,  True],
      ["Leo",      "Morgan",    11, "Wilberforce", 112, 76.5,  False],
      ["Sophie",   "Turner",     8, "Barnardo",     87, 95.0,  False],
      ["Hannah",   "Lewis",      8, "Barnardo",     89, 97.0,  False]
  ]

  ```


  Write two functions:


  1. `print_first_names(students)`\
     Traverses the 2D list and prints **only the first names**.

     > Hint: The first name is always at index `0` of each row.

     Example output:

     ```
     Taha
     Aisha
     Leo
     Sophie
     Hannah
     ```

  2. `list_house(students, house)`\
     **Returns** a list of just the names of students in a given house, as strings, for example
     `list_house(students, "Barnardo")` should return 

     ```
     ["Sophie Turner", "Hannah Lewis"]
     ```

  ***


  ## Question 3: Update a 2D Seating Plan


  In **q3.py**, you will see a **4×5** seating plan (a 2D list) where each
  element is either a student name or `"EMPTY"`.


  Write a function:


  ```python

  assign_seat(plan, row, col, name)

  ```


  This function should:


  * update the seat at the given row and column


  * replace `"EMPTY"` with the student’s name


  * leave other seats unchanged


  Then write another function:


  ```python

  print_plan(plan)

  ```


  that prints the seating plan row by row.


  > Challenge: After assigning a few seats, print the whole plan to check your
  updates.
