  ## &#x20;Example 1: Printing a Times Table (2D List of Numbers)


  This example shows how to generate and display a **multiplication table**,
  stored as a 2D list.


  ```python

  def print_times_table(table):
      for row in table:
          for value in row:
              print(f"{value:<4}", end=" ")
          print()

  # Create a 5×5 multiplication table

  times_table = []

  for i in range(1, 6):
      row = []
      for j in range(1, 6):
          row.append(i * j)
      times_table.append(row)

  print_times_table(times_table)

  ```

  ## Example 2: Counting How Many Values Meet a Condition


  This program counts how many marks in a 2D list are **above 70**.


  ```python

  def count_high_scores(marks):
      count = 0
      for row in marks:
          for mark in row:
              if mark > 70:
                  count += 1
      return count

  marks = [
      [65, 72, 81],
      [90, 55, 68],
      [74, 88, 60]
  ]


  print("Scores above 70:", count_high_scores(marks))

  ```

  ## Example 3: Finding the Longest String in a 2D List


  This example uses a 2D list of **words** and finds the longest one.


  ```python

  def longest_word(grid):
      longest = ""
      for row in grid:
          for word in row:
              if len(word) > len(longest):
                  longest = word
      return longest

  words = [
      ["cat", "elephant", "dog"],
      ["sun", "mountain", "tree"],
      ["python", "loop", "iteration"]
  ]


  print("Longest word:", longest_word(words))

  ```
