title: Programming with 2D arrays
content: >+
  Let's dive into some more examples of programming with 2D arrays in Python.


  ## Example 1: Printing a Times Table&#x20;


  This example shows how to generate and display a **times
  table** aka **multiplication table**, stored as a 2D list.


  ```python

  def print_times_table(table):
      for row in table:
          for value in row:
              print(f"{value:<4}", end=" ")
          print()

  # Create a 5×5 multiplication table

  times_table = []

  for i in range(1, 6):
      row = []
      for j in range(1, 6):
          row.append(i * j)
      times_table.append(row)

  print_times_table(times_table)

  ```


  ### Explanation


  * The function `print_times_table` takes a 2D list (a list of rows) and prints
  it neatly.


  * The **outer loop** goes through each row of the table.


  * The **inner loop** goes through each value inside that row.


  * `print(f"{value:<4}", end=" ")` prints each number left‑aligned in a
  4‑character space so the columns line up.


  * After printing one full row, `print()` moves to the next line.


  * The program then **creates** a 5×5 multiplication table.


  * The outer loop (`for i in range(1, 6)`) builds each row for numbers 1 to 5.


  * For each row, an inner loop (`for j in range(1, 6)`) calculates `i * j` and
  appends it to the row.


  * Each completed row is appended to `times_table`, forming a 2D list.


  * Finally, the program calls `print_times_table(times_table)` to display the
  whole table.

  ## Example 2: Counting How Many Values Meet a Condition


  This program counts how many marks in a 2D list are **above 70**.


  ```python

  def count_high_scores(marks):
      count = 0
      for row in marks:
          for mark in row:
              if mark > 70:
                  count += 1
      return count

  marks = [
      [65, 72, 81],
      [90, 55, 68],
      [74, 88, 60]
  ]


  print("Scores above 70:", count_high_scores(marks))

  ```


  ### Explanation


  * The function `count_high_scores` takes a 2D list of marks.


  * A variable `count` is set to 0 to keep track of how many marks are above 70.


  * The **outer loop** goes through each row of marks (each student’s set of
  scores).


  * The **inner loop** goes through each individual mark inside that row.


  * The `if mark > 70:` condition checks whether the current mark meets the
  requirement.


  * If it does, `count += 1` increases the total.


  * After all rows and marks have been checked, the function returns the final
  count.


  * The program defines a 3×3 list of marks and calls the function.


  * Finally, it prints how many scores in the whole 2D list are above 70.

  ## PRIMM Activities


  Using the attached **`word_lengths.py`**:


  1. 🤔 **Predict**\
     What do you think the program will print as the longest word?\
     Which row do you think it will come from?

  2. ▶️ **Run**\
     Run the program and compare the actual output with your prediction.

  3. 🔍 **Investigate**

     * What does the variable `longest` store during the loop?

     * Why does the program need **two** `for` loops to search the whole 2D list?

     * What does the condition `len(word) > len(longest)` check?

  4. ✏️ **Modify**\
     Change the program so it also prints the **length** of the longest word, e.g.\
     `Longest word: elephant (8 letters)`.

  5. 🛠️ **Make**\
     Open **word\_search.py** and write a new function that counts how many words in the 2D list have **more than 5 letters**. Test it using the example grid provided.
