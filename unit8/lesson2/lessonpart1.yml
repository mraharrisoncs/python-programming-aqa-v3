title: Traversing a 2D array
content: >+
  In this section, we'll explore how to traverse a 2D array using a for loop in
  Python. We'll start by examining the `view_students` function from the
  previous lesson, which demonstrates how to iterate over a list of lists.


  ### Traversing a 2D Array


  A 2D array, or a list of lists in Python, can be thought of as a table with
  rows and columns. To traverse a 2D array, you typically use nested for loops:
  one loop to iterate over the rows and another loop to iterate over the
  elements within each row.


  Here's how the `view_students` function works:


  ```python

  def view_students(students):
      for student in students:
          print(student)
  ```


  In this function, `students` is a 2D list where each element is a list
  representing a student's record. The function uses a single for loop to
  iterate over each student (or row) in the `students` list and prints the
  entire student record.


  If we want to lay out this data in a neat table, we need to traverse each
  **element** within the student records using a nested for loop:


  ```python

  def view_students_detailed(students):
      for student in students:
          for detail in student:
              print(f"{detail:<15}", end=' ')
          print()  # Move to the next line after printing all details of a student
  ```


  ### Explanation


  * **Outer Loop**: The outer loop iterates over each student (or row) in the
  `students` list.


  * **Inner Loop**: The inner loop iterates over each detail (or column) within
  a student's record, printing each detail on the same line with a fixed width
  for neat alignment\*


  * **End of Line**: After printing all details of a student, `print()` is
  called to move to the next line for the next student.


  > \*In the code `print(f"{detail:<15}", end=' ')`, the `:<15` is a
  **formatting code** that tells Python to align the field to the left (hence
  the `<` symbol) and pad to 15 characters on the right with spaces, and `end='
  '` means "at the end of this output print a space, **not** a newline
  character" - this keeps all the output on one line.
