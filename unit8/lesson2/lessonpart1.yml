title: Traversing a 2D array
content: >+
  In this section, we'll explore how to traverse a 2D array using a for loop in
  Python. We'll start by examining the `view_students` function from the
  previous lesson, which demonstrates how to iterate over a list of lists.


  ### Traversing a 2D Array


  A 2D array, or a list of lists in Python, can be thought of as a table with
  rows and columns. To traverse a 2D array, you typically use nested for loops:
  one loop to iterate over the rows and another loop to iterate over the
  elements within each row.


  Here's how the `view_students` function works:


  ```python

  def view_students(students):
      for student in students:
          print(student)
  ```


  In this function, `students` is a 2D list where each element is a list
  representing a student's record. The function uses a single for loop to
  iterate over each student (or row) in the `students` list and prints the
  entire student record.


  If we want to lay out this data in a neat table, we need to traverse each
  **element** within the student records using a nested for loop:


  ```python

  def view_students_detailed(students):
      for student in students:
          for detail in student:
              print(f"{detail:<15}", end=' ')
          print()  # Move to the next line after printing all details of a student
  ```


  ### Explanation


  * **Outer Loop**: The outer loop iterates over each student (or row) in the
  `students` list.


  * **Inner Loop**: The inner loop iterates over each detail (or column) within
  a student's record, printing each detail on the same line with a fixed width
  for neat alignment\*


  * **End of Line**: After printing all details of a student, `print()` is
  called to move to the next line for the next student.


  > \*In the code `print(f"{detail:<15}", end=' ')`, the `:<15` is a
  **formatting code** that tells Python to align the field to the left (hence
  the `<` symbol) and pad to 15 characters on the right with spaces, and `end='
  '` means "at the end of this output print a space, **not** a newline
  character" - this keeps all the output on one line.

          function?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: To iterate over each student in the 2D list.
            explanation: No, this describes the purpose of the outer loop.
          - id: "2"
            value: To iterate over each detail within a student's record.
            explanation: Yes, the inner loop iterates over each element in a student's
              record.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "3"
            value: To print a newline after each student's details.
            explanation: No, this is done by the `print()` statement after the inner loop.

          'view_students_detailed()' function?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: It iterates over each student record in the students list.
            explanation: Yes, it iterates over each student (or row) in the 2D list.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: It prints each student's details on a new line.
            explanation: No, it does not print; it only iterates over the student records.
          - id: "3"
            value: It formats each student's details for display.
            explanation: No, formatting is done in the inner loop, not by this statement.
          - id: "4"
            value: It initializes the students list.
            explanation: No, the students list is passed as a parameter, not initialized
              here.

        options:
          - id: "1"

            explanation: Yes, each sublist represents a student's record.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: A single student's detail
            explanation: No, each sublist contains multiple details of a student.
          - id: "3"
            value: A column of student details such as first name
            explanation: No, each sublist represents a row, not a column.
          - id: "4"
            value: A list of student names
            explanation: No, each sublist contains more than just names.

        type: choice
        content: When using a nested loop to traverse a 2D list, what is the order in
          which the elements are visited?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Row by row, visiting each element in a row before moving to the next row.
            explanation: Yes, the outer loop iterates over rows and the inner loop iterates
              over elements within each row.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: Column by column, visiting each element in a column before moving to the
              next column.
            explanation: No, the traversal is done row by row, not column by column.
          - id: "3"
            value: Diagonally, starting from the top-left to the bottom-right.
            explanation: No, the traversal is not done diagonally.
          - id: "4"
            value: Randomly, visiting elements in no particular order.
            explanation: "No, the traversal follows a specific order: row by row."
