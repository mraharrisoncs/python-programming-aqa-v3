  ### Append to a 2D Array


  In Python, a 2D array can be represented as a list of lists. You can append a
  new row (a list) to a 2D array using the `append` method. Here's an example:


  ```python

  >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

  >>> matrix.append([10, 11, 12])

  >>> matrix

  [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]

  ```


  ### Remove from a 2D Array


  To remove a row from a 2D array, you can use the `remove` method or the `del`
  statement. The `remove` method will remove the first occurrence of a matching
  row, while `del` can be used to remove a row by its index:


  Using `remove`:


  ```python

  >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]

  >>> matrix.remove([4, 5, 6])

  >>> matrix

  [[1, 2, 3], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]

  ```


  Using `del`:


  ```python

  >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]

  >>> del matrix[1]

  >>> matrix

  [[1, 2, 3], [10, 11, 12]]

  ```


  ### Slicing a 2D Array


  Slicing can be used to extract a portion of a 2D array. You can slice rows or
  elements within rows. Here’s how you can slice rows:


  ```python

  >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]

  >>> sub_matrix = matrix[1:3]

  >>> sub_matrix

  [[4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]

  ```


  To slice elements within rows, you can specify the range for both dimensions:


  ```python

  >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]

  >>> sub_matrix = [row[1:3] for row in matrix]

  >>> sub_matrix

  [[2, 3], [5, 6], [8, 9], [11, 12]]

  ```


  Try out these operations in your Python environment to get a better
  understanding of how 2D arrays work!
