title: 2D array operations - append and remove
content: >
  All the list operations that work on 1D arrays also work on 2D arrays.


  ### Append to a 2D Array


  You can append a new row (as a new **sublist**) to a 2D array using the
  `append` method. Here's an example using our `temperatures` array:


  ```python

  >>> temperatures = [

  ...     [24, 26, 31, 26, 21, 18, 22],

  ...     [30, 32, 33, 31, 29, 28, 27],

  ...     [20, 22, 25, 23, 21, 19, 18]

  ... ]


  >>> temperatures.append([25, 27, 29, 28, 26, 24, 23])

  >>> temperatures

  [[24, 26, 31, 26, 21, 18, 22], [30, 32, 33, 31, 29, 28, 27], [20, 22, 25, 23,
  21, 19, 18], [25, 27, 29, 28, 26, 24, 23]]

  ```


  ### Delete row from a 2D Array


  To remove a row from a 2D array, you *can* use the `remove` method, but you
  would need to specify the contents of the **entire row** you want to remove,
  which is tricky so we don't usually do that.


  Instead use the `del` statement with the row's index.


  Using `del`:


  ```python

  >>> students = [

  ...     ["Taha", "Hussain", 10, "Pankhurst", 104, 93.5, False],

  ...     ["Leo", "Morgan", 11, "Wilberforce", 112, 76.5, False]

  ... ]


  >>> del students[1]

  >>> students

  [['Taha', 'Hussain', 10, 'Pankhurst', 104, 93.5, False]]

  ```


  Try these operations in the REPL now, then answer these questions:
