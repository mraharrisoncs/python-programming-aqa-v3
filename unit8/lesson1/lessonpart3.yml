title: 2D array operations - append and remove
content: >+
  All the list operations that work on 1D arrays also work on 2D arrays.


  ### Append to a 2D Array


  You can append a new row (as a new **sublist**) to a 2D array using the
  `append` method. Here's an example using our `game_grid` array:


  ```python

  >>> game_grid = [
      ["Start", "Path", "Treasure"],
      ["Path", "Enemy", "Path"],
      ["Path", "Path", "End"]
  ]


  >>> game_grid.append(["House", "Garden", "End"])

  >>> game_grid

  [["Start", "Path", "Treasure"],["Path", "Enemy", "Path"],["Path", "Path",
  "End"],["House", "Garden", "End"])


  ```


  ### Delete row from a 2D Array


  To remove a row from a 2D array, you *can* use the `remove` method, but you
  would need to specify the contents of the **entire row** you want to remove,
  which is tricky so we don't usually do that.


  Instead we use the `del` statement with the row's index: 


  ```python

  >>> students = [

  ...     ["Taha", "Hussain", 10, "Pankhurst", 104, 93.5, False],

  ...     ["Leo", "Morgan", 11, "Wilberforce", 112, 76.5, False]

  ... ]


  >>> del students[1]

  >>> students

  [['Taha', 'Hussain', 10, 'Pankhurst', 104, 93.5, False]]

  ```


  Try these operations in the REPL now, then answer these questions:

showTerminal: true
questionGroups:
  - id: "1"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Given a 2D array register=[[1,1],[1,0]], write an instruction to append
          a new sublist [0,1] as a row to the 2D array.
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: register.append([0,1])
            explanation: Yes, this correctly appends the sublist [0,1] to the 2D array.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: register.add([0,1])
            explanation: No, 'add' is not a valid method for lists in Python.
          - id: "3"
            value: register([0,1])
            explanation: No, this is a syntax error, as you have forgotten to use the
              append() method
          - id: "4"
            value: append([0,1]).register
            explanation: No, append() is a list method, so we write it after the list
              identifier, register.append(...)
  - id: "2"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: string
        content: Write a statement to delete the first row of a 2D array called
          'temperatures'.
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: del temperatures[0]
            explanation: The 'del' statement removes the row at the specified index.
            isCorrect: true
