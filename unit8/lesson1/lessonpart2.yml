title: Creating and using 2D arrays in Python
content: >
  ## Creating a 2D array


  In Python, a 2D array can be represented using a **list of lists**. Each
  **sublist** represents a row in the 2D array. Here's how you can create a 2D
  array:


  ```python

  matrix = [
      [1, 2, 3],
      [4, 5, 6],
      [7, 8, 9]
  ]

  ```


  Just like 1D arrays (lists) we use square brackets. We need one pair of
  brackets for the outer list, then another pair of brackets around **each
  sublist**, separated by commas. Each sublist contains elements that represent
  the columns in that row.


  > Note: although Python doesn't have genuine arrays, and uses *lists of lists*
  to implement 2D arrays, we will just use the phrase **2D array** in the rest
  of this unit, for simplicity!


  ## Python 2D arrays can contain any data type


  All Python data structures can contain integers, floats, strings, Booleans, or
  even other lists. Here are some more examples of 2D array assignments:


  ```python

  # create a 2D array of temperatures for different cities over a week

  temperatures = [
      [24, 26, 31, 26, 21, 18, 22],  # City 1
      [30, 32, 33, 31, 29, 28, 27],  # City 2
      [20, 22, 25, 23, 21, 19, 18]   # City 3
  ]


  # create a 2D array of student records, each containing 

  # first name, surname, year group, house, form, score, EAL status

  students = [
      ["Taha",     "Hussain",   10, "Pankhurst",   104, 93.5,  False],
      ["Aisha",    "Khan",       9, "Nightingale",  91, 88.0,  True],
      ["Leo",      "Morgan",    11, "Wilberforce", 112, 76.5,  False],
      ["Sophie",   "Turner",     8, "Barnardo",     87, 95.0,  False],
      ["Hannah",   "Lewis",      8, "Barnardo",     89, 97.0,  False]
  ]


  # create a 2D array representing a grid in a game, with each cell containing a
  description

  game_grid = [
      ["Start", "Path", "Treasure"],
      ["Path", "Enemy", "Path"],
      ["Path", "Path", "End"]
  ]

  ```


  ## Accessing an item in a 2D array


  We can access an item in a 2D array by specifying the row index and the column
  index, both starting from 0:


  ```python

  >>> matrix = [
      [1, 2, 3],
      [4, 5, 6],
      [7, 8, 9]
  ]


  # Access the element in the first row, second column

  >>> matrix[0][1]

  2


  # Access the element in the third row, third column

  >>> matrix[2][2]

  9


  >>> students = [
      ["Taha",     "Hussain",   10, "Pankhurst",   104, 93.5,  False],
      ["Aisha",    "Khan",       9, "Nightingale",  91, 88.0,  True],
      ["Leo",      "Morgan",    11, "Wilberforce", 112, 76.5,  False],
      ["Sophie",   "Turner",     8, "Barnardo",     87, 95.0,  False],
      ["Hannah",   "Lewis",      8, "Barnardo",     89, 97.0,  False]
  ]


  # Access the year group (column index 2) of the second student (row index 1)

  >>> students[1][2]

  9

  ```


  Now open the REPL and try the above commands. Then try the questions below.
