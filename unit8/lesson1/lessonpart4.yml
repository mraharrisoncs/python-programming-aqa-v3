title: Simple programming with 2D arrays
content: >
  In this section, we'll explore some basic programming tasks using 2D arrays in
  Python. We'll use the `temperatures` and `students` arrays from the previous
  examples.


  ## Example 1: Student Records Program


  Let's create a simple student records program with functions to view, append,
  and remove student records.


  ```python

  def view_students(students):
      for student in students:
          print(student)

  def append_student(students, new_student):
      students.append(new_student)

  def remove_student(students, student_to_remove):
      students.remove(student_to_remove)

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  students = [
      ["Taha", "Hussain", 10, "Pankhurst", 104, 93.5, False],
      ["Aisha", "Khan", 9, "Nightingale", 91, 88.0, True],
      ["Leo", "Morgan", 11, "Wilberforce", 112, 76.5, False]
  ]


  # View students

  view_students(students)


  # Append a new student

  append_student(students, ["Nina", "Patel", 12, "Curie", 115, 89.0, True])

  print("After appending a new student:")

  view_students(students)


  # Remove a student

  remove_student(students, ["Aisha", "Khan", 9, "Nightingale", 91, 88.0, True])

  print("After removing a student:")

  view_students(students)

  ```


  ### Explanation


  * The `view_students` function iterates over the list of students and prints
  each student's details (see next lesson!)


  * The `append_student` function adds a new student's details to the end of the
  list.


  * The `remove_student` function removes a specific student's details from the
  list based on the provided information.


  * The main program initializes a list of students and demonstrates viewing,
  appending, and removing student records.


  > Note: In Python, arrays (or lists) are **passed by reference**, meaning that
  when you pass a list to a function, you are passing a **reference** to the
  original list, not a copy. This means any changes within the function **modify
  the original list**. 


  ## Example 2: Temperature Analysis Program


  Now, let's create a temperature analysis program with functions to view,
  append, and remove temperature records.


  ```python

  def view_temperatures(temperatures):
      for week in temperatures:
          print(week)

  def append_temperature(temperatures, new_week):
      temperatures.append(new_week)

  def remove_temperature(temperatures, week_index):
      del temperatures[week_index]

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  temperatures = [
      [24, 26, 31, 26, 21, 18, 22],
      [30, 32, 33, 31, 29, 28, 27],
      [20, 22, 25, 23, 21, 19, 18]
  ]


  # View temperatures

  view_temperatures(temperatures)


  # Append a new week's temperatures

  append_temperature(temperatures, [25, 27, 29, 28, 26, 24, 23])

  print("After appending a new week's temperatures:")

  view_temperatures(temperatures)


  # Remove a week's temperatures

  remove_temperature(temperatures, 1)

  print("After removing a week's temperatures:")

  view_temperatures(temperatures)

  ```


  ### Explanation


  * The `view_temperatures` function iterates over the list of weekly
  temperatures and prints each week's data.


  * The `append_temperature` function adds a new week's temperature data to the
  end of the list.


  * The `remove_temperature` function deletes a week's temperature data from the
  list based on the specified index.


  * The main program initializes a list of weekly temperatures and demonstrates
  viewing, appending, and removing temperature records.


  Try out these examples in the attached Python files, then attempt this PRIMM
  exercise.

  ## PRIMM Activity — Weekly Timetable (2D Arrays)


  ### **Example timetable**


  ```

  +-----------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

  | Day       | P1     | P2     | P3     | P4     | P5     |

  +-----------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

  | Monday    | ENG    | MATH   | SCI    | GEO    | COMP   |

  +-----------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

  | Tuesday   | HIST   | ENG    | MATH   | ART    | COMP   |

  +-----------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

  | Wednesday | MATH   | SCI    | ENG    | COMP   | HIST   |

  +-----------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

  | Thursday  | SCI    | GEO    | MATH   | ENG    | ART    |

  +-----------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

  | Friday    | COMP   | ENG    | SCI    | MATH   | PE     |

  +-----------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

  ```


  ```python

  #STARTER CODE in timetable_2D.py

  timetable = [
      ["ENG",  "MATH", "SCI",  "GEO",  "COMP"],   # Monday
      ["HIST", "ENG",  "MATH", "ART",  "COMP"],   # Tuesday
      ["MATH", "SCI",  "ENG",  "COMP", "HIST"],   # Wednesday
      ["SCI",  "GEO",  "MATH", "ENG",  "ART"],    # Thursday
      ["COMP", "ENG",  "SCI",  "MATH", "PE"],     # Friday
  ]


  days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"]


  def update_lesson(timetable, day_name, period_number, new_subject):
      day_index = days.index(day_name)
      period_index = period_number - 1
      timetable[day_index][period_index] = new_subject

  # Example use

  update_lesson(timetable, "Thursday", 3, "COMP")

  print(timetable)

  ```


  ***


  ### 1. 🤔 Predict


  Before running the program:


  * What do you think the timetable will look like after the update?


  * Which lesson on Thursday is being changed?


  * Why does the code use `period_number - 1`?


  Write down your predictions.


  ***


  ### 2. ▶️ Run


  Run the program in your Python environment.


  * Compare the printed timetable with your prediction.


  * Did the update happen where you expected?


  ***


  ### 3. 🔍 Investigate


  Answer these questions to understand the program more deeply:


  * What does `days.index(day_name)` return?


  * Why does `.index()` work here, even though this is a 2D array?


  * What are the **rows** and **columns** representing in this structure?


  * What happens if you try to update `"Saturday"`?


  ***


  ### 4. ✏️ Modify


  Make the following changes:


  * Change Monday Period 1 to `"COMP"`.


  * Change Friday Period 5 to `"TUTOR"`.


  * Add a new day `"Saturday"` with 5 `"REV"` lessons using `append`.


  * Update Saturday Period 3 to `"MATH"`.


  Run the program again to check your changes.


  ***


  ### 5. 🛠️ Make


  Write a function called:


  ```python

  print_day(timetable, day_name)

  ```


  This function should:


  * find the correct row for the given day


  * print the day name


  * print all 5 lessons in order, e.g.:


  ```

  Wednesday: MATH, SCI, ENG, COMP, HIST

  ```


  Test your function with at least **three** different days.
