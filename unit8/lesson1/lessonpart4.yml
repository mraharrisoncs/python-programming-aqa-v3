title: Simple programming with 2D arrays
content: >
  In this section, we'll explore some basic programming tasks using 2D arrays in
  Python. We'll use the `temperatures` and `students` arrays from the previous
  examples.


  ## Student Records Program


  Let's create a simple student records program with functions to view, append,
  and remove student records.


  ```python

  def view_students(students):
      for student in students:
          print(student)

  def append_student(students, new_student):
      students.append(new_student)

  def remove_student(students, student_to_remove):
      students.remove(student_to_remove)

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  students = [
      ["Taha", "Hussain", 10, "Pankhurst", 104, 93.5, False],
      ["Aisha", "Khan", 9, "Nightingale", 91, 88.0, True],
      ["Leo", "Morgan", 11, "Wilberforce", 112, 76.5, False]
  ]


  # View students

  view_students(students)


  # Append a new student

  append_student(students, ["Nina", "Patel", 12, "Curie", 115, 89.0, True])

  print("\nAfter appending a new student:")

  view_students(students)


  # Remove a student

  remove_student(students, ["Aisha", "Khan", 9, "Nightingale", 91, 88.0, True])

  print("\nAfter removing a student:")

  view_students(students)

  ```


  ### Explanation


  * The `view_students` function iterates over the list of students and prints
  each student's details (see next lesson!)


  * The `append_student` function adds a new student's details to the end of the
  list.


  * The `remove_student` function removes a specific student's details from the
  list based on the provided information.


  * The main program initializes a list of students and demonstrates viewing,
  appending, and removing student records.


  > Note: In Python, arrays (or lists) are **passed by reference**, meaning that
  when you pass a list to a function, you are passing a **reference** to the
  original list, not a copy. This means any changes within the function **modify
  the original list**.


  ## Temperature Analysis Program


  Now, let's create a temperature analysis program with functions to view,
  append, and remove temperature records.


  ```python

  def view_temperatures(temperatures):
      for week in temperatures:
          print(week)

  def append_temperature(temperatures, new_week):
      temperatures.append(new_week)

  def remove_temperature(temperatures, week_index):
      del temperatures[week_index]

  # MAIN PROGRAM

  temperatures = [
      [24, 26, 31, 26, 21, 18, 22],
      [30, 32, 33, 31, 29, 28, 27],
      [20, 22, 25, 23, 21, 19, 18]
  ]


  # View temperatures

  view_temperatures(temperatures)


  # Append a new week's temperatures

  append_temperature(temperatures, [25, 27, 29, 28, 26, 24, 23])

  print("\nAfter appending a new week's temperatures:")

  view_temperatures(temperatures)


  # Remove a week's temperatures

  remove_temperature(temperatures, 1)

  print("\nAfter removing a week's temperatures:")

  view_temperatures(temperatures)

  ```


  ### Explanation


  * The `view_temperatures` function iterates over the list of weekly
  temperatures and prints each week's data.


  * The `append_temperature` function adds a new week's temperature data to the
  end of the list.


  * The `remove_temperature` function deletes a week's temperature data from the
  list based on the specified index.


  * The main program initializes a list of weekly temperatures and demonstrates
  viewing, appending, and removing temperature records.
