title: Length of a string
content: |
  Let's look in more detail at finding the length of a string. If we execute this code it will **assign** the string literal "Computer Science" to the variable subject:

  ```python
  >>> subject = "Computer Science"
  ```

  Under the covers, this is stored in the computer as a sequence of ASCII characters with index values, like this:

  ```python
  subject
  +--------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  | Index  |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  | 
  +--------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  | Char   |  C  |  o  |  m  |  p  |  u  |  t  |  e  |  r  |     |  S  |  c  |  i  |  e  |  n  |  c  |  e  |
  +--------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  | ASCII  |  67 | 111 | 109 | 112 | 117 | 116 | 101 | 114 |  32 |  83 |  99 | 105 | 101 | 110 |  99 | 101 | 
  +--------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  ```

  We can use the **len()** function in Python to get the length of a string:

  ```python
  >>> subject = "Computer Science"
  >>> print(len(subject))
  16
  ```

  We could use `len()` on a string **literal** such as "Computer Science" or "Hello World!", or on a string **variable** like `subject` or `greeting`. We can also assign the returned value to a variable:

  ```python
  >>> print(len("Computer Science"))
  16
  >>> greeting = "Hello World!"
  >>> greeting_length = len(greeting)
  >>> print(greeting_length)
  12
  ```

  ## Pseudocode advice

  In AQA exam papers, you will see the all caps **LEN()** function used to calculate the length of a string. This behaves exactly like Python's len() function. Remember that in pseudocode we also use OUTPUT instead of print():

  ```python
   subject = "Computer Science"
   OUTPUT LEN(subject)

  16
  ```

        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "5"
            explanation: Wrong, len() counts the characters in the string.
          - id: "2"
            value: "6"
            explanation: Correct, there are six characters in "squash".
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "3"
            value: squash
            explanation: Wrong, len() means length, which is an integer value.

            explanation: Wrong, len() means length, which is an integer value.

        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "8"
            explanation: No, make sure you count spaces and punctuation!
          - id: "2"
            value: "9"
            explanation: No, all characters are counted, not just letters and spaces.
          - id: "3"
            value: "10"
            explanation: Yes, the string has ten characters.

          - id: "2"
            value: pw_length
            explanation: No, pw_length is a variable so its contents will be printed, not
              its identifier.

            value: "7"
            explanation: No, count again!

              than 8.
