  ### What is a String?


  In programming, a **string** is a sequence of characters used to represent
  text. Strings can include letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces. They are one
  of the most commonly used data types in programming languages, including
  Python. "Hello World!" is an example of a string.


  In this code we assign the string **literal**, "Hello World!" to a string
  **variable** with the identifier **greeting:**


  ```python

  greeting = "Hello World!"

  ```


  <br />


  ### Structure of a String


  The string above consists of a sequence of characters stored under a single
  **identifier**, *greeting*. Within the string, each character has an
  **index** value. Python, like most programming languages, indexes everything
  from zero.&#x20;


  Here is that *greeting* string again, showing the index of each character:


  ```python

  greeting

  +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

  |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10  | 11  |

  +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

  |  H  |  e  |  l  |  l  |  o  |     |  W  |  o  |  r  |  l  |  d  |  !  |

  +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

  ```


  As you can see, the 'H' in "Hello World!" has index zero, the space between
  words has index 5, and the exclamation mark at the end has index 11. 


  If we wanted to split this string into two words, we could split into a string
  that goes from position 0 to position 4 giving us "Hello", and position 6 to
  position 11 giving us "World!". These two strings are **substrings** of the
  original string. We will find out how to do substrings later.


  We can also join strings together using the `+` symbol, this is called
  **concatenation**. For example:


  ```python

  >>> print("Hello " + "World!")

  Hello World!

  ```


  Notice that we had to include a space at the end of Hello.
  **Concatenation** does not add any spaces to the result. \[NB. print("Hello",
  "World") would have inserted a space, but this is NOT concatenation!]


  What is the **length** of the string "Hello World!"?

        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "0"
            explanation: No, this is the length of the empty string "".
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "11"
            explanation: No, the index of the last character is 11, but count how many there
              are!
          - id: "3"
            value: "12"
            explanation: Yes, there are 12 characters in the string, indexed 0 to 11.
