title: Starter - data types
content: >
  All programming languages have basic or **primitive** data types such as
  integer and Boolean. Here is a piece of Python code that assigns some data to
  variables with different data types.


  ```python

  # Assigning values to variables of different data types


  # Integer

  age = 25


  # Float

  height = 5.9


  # String

  name = "Alice"


  # Boolean

  is_student = True


  # Print the variables

  print("Age:", age)

  print("Height:", height)

  print("Name:", name)

  print("Is Student:", is_student)

  ```


  Once you have refreshed your memory by reading through the above code, try the
  starter quiz below\...
questionGroups:
  - id: "1"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What data type has only two values, True and False?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Integer
            explanation: No, this is a whole number like 1 or -99
          - id: "2"
            value: Real/float
            explanation: No this is a real number such as 3.45
          - id: "3"
            value: Boolean
            explanation: Yes, Boolean variables can take only True or False as values
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "4"
            value: character

              or "!"
  - id: "2"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: 'Which data type does this expression have: "Hello World"?'
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: String
            explanation: Yes, it is a sequence of characters, which is a string data type
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: Integer
            explanation: No, this is a whole number like 1 or -99
          - id: "3"
            value: Boolean
            explanation: No, this data type represents true or false values, not sequences
              of characters
          - id: "4"
            value: Real
            explanation: A real / float data type represents decimal numbers, not sequences
              of characters
  - id: "3"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: multiple
        content: "These values are a mixture of data types. Select all the real numbers
          (floats):"
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "3.14"
            explanation: Yes, 3.14 is a real number represented as a float.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "42"
            explanation: No, 42 is an integer, not a float.
          - id: "3"
            value: "True"
            explanation: No, True is a Boolean value, not a float.
          - id: "4"
            value: "-2.718"
            explanation: Yes, -2.718 is a real number represented as a float.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "5"
            value: '"Hello"'
            explanation: No, "Hello" is a string, not a float.
  - id: "4"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: multiple
        content: "Select all the strings:"
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: '"Hello, World!"'
            explanation: Yes, this is a string because it is a sequence of characters.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "42"
            explanation: No, This is an integer, not a string.
          - id: "3"
            value: "'Python'"
            explanation: Yes, this is a string - we can use either double quotes or single
              quotes, as long as they match!
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "4"
            value: "True"
            explanation: No, this is a Boolean value, not a string.
  - id: "5"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Some languages support the character or char data type, which stores a
          single character. Python does not. Without the char data type, how
          would we best store someone's first initial in Python?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: As a string of length 1
            explanation: Yes, Python just uses the string data type for single or multiple
              character strings
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: As an integer
            explanation: No, although "under the covers" this is what happens, in our
              program we would use a string
          - id: "3"
            value: As a Boolean
            explanation: No, we could not store a letter in a Boolean variable
          - id: "4"
            value: You can't store a single character in a Python variable
            explanation: Not true, we can use a string variable
