title: Programming with len() 2
content: >
  Let's use len() in a word game! 


  Open the attached program and try doing the following.


  ## PRIMM Activities


  1. **🤔 Predict** what the program does.

  2. ▶️ **Run** and check your prediction, were you correct?

  3. 🔍 **Investigate:** what function is used to calculate the length of the
  string? 

  4. ✏️ **Modify:** Change the program so each letter is worth eight points.

     Place the scoring logic inside a function called **`word_score()`** and call it in the main program with the word "lettuce", which should now score 56. Run and test your code.
  5. 🛠️ **Make:** a new word game that gives zero points for words of five
  letters or less, then a point for every letter after the fifth letter in the
  word, so "apple" scores 0 but "banana" scores 1 and "pineapple" scores 4.
