title: Programming with substrings
content: >+
  You have now learned `len()` and string slicing with `identifier[start :
  end]`. Let's put our knowledge to work in some real programs.


  You’ve been given a string stored in the variable hero = "Ada Lovelace".


  Open the Python program and add code that:


  1. Prints the length of the string.

  2. Extracts and prints the first name.

  3. Extracts and prints the last name.

  4. Prints the last 4 characters **using negative indexing**. 

  5. Splits the string into three equal length parts and joins them in reverse
  order, printing the result like this; "laceLoveAda ". *Hint, you will need to*
  ***concatenate** the substrings with* ***`+`**.*

          remember that the 'end' value should be 1 higher than the last
          character in your substring?
