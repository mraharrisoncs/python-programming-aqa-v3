title: Substrings, aka string slicing
content: |+
  ## String slicing

  You've seen how to access individual characters in a string using their index positions. Now we're going to see how to extract substrings of more than one character. 

  The basic Python syntax for substrings, also know as **string slicing**, is this:&#x20;

  ```python
  identifier[start : end]
  ```

  where **identifier** is our variable name, **start** is the starting position of the substring, and **end** is the first character we **don't want!** This seems strange at first, but you will get used to it, just make the second value **one more** than the last character you want to extract. Let's look at `subject = "Computer Science"` again:

  ```python
  subject
  +--------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  | Index  |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10  | 11  | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  | 
  +--------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  | Char   |  C  |  o  |  m  |  p  |  u  |  t  |  e  |  r  |     |  S  |  c  |  i  |  e  |  n  |  c  |  e  |
  +--------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  ```

  If we want the first character, "C", we can just write `subject[0]`. If we want the whole string "Computer" we specify start of 0, and end at position 8, one place after the "r":

  ```python
  >>> subject = "Computer Science"
  >>> print(subject[0 : 8])
  Computer
  ```

  ## Assumed end of string

  We can omit the start position "0" if we want to slice from the start of the string, just type the colon and the end position like this:

  ```python
  >>> subject[:8]
  Computer
  ```

  We can omit the end position too, if we want a slice up to the end of the string, just type the start position and a colon like this:

  ```python
  >>> subject[9:]
  Science
  ```

  ## Indexing in reverse!

  We can index from the end of the string too! Just use a negative value, starting with -1 for the last character. If you want the last seven characters - that means index -7 to -1 - then do this:

  ```python
  >>> subject[-7:-1]
  Science
  ```

  And yes, again we can omit the start or end indices, and Python will know we mean "to end of string":

  ```python
  >>> subject[-7:]
  Science

  >>> "execute"[-4:]
  cute
  ```

  Notice that  the string can be a string **literal** or a string **variable**, or indeed any **expression** that evaluates to a string, such as `input("name")` or `firstname + lastname` where these are two string variables. This is generally true of Python, expressions can be used almost anywhere a variable can!

  ## Lots of examples

  Let's see some more examples of string slicing in Python:

  ```python
  +------------------+-------------+--------------------------------------------+
  | Slice Syntax     | Result      | Description                                |
  +------------------+-------------+--------------------------------------------+
  | subject[0:8]     | 'Computer'  | # First word (index 0 to 7)                |
  | subject[9:16]    | 'Science'   | # Second word (index 9 to 15)              |
  | subject[9:]      | 'Science'   | # From index 9 to end                      |
  | subject[:8]      | 'Computer'  | # From start to index 7                    |
  | subject[3:6]     | 'put'       | # Middle of "Computer"                     |
  | subject[8:9]     | ' '         | # The space between words                  |
  | subject[-7:]     | 'Science'   | # Last 7 characters using negative index   |
  | subject[-7:-4]   | 'Sci'       | # First 3 letters of "Science"             |
  | subject[-1]      | 'e'         | # Last character                           |
  | subject[:-8]     | 'Computer'  | # Everything except the last eight chars   |
  +------------------+-------------+--------------------------------------------+
  ```

  ## Pseudocode notes

  In AQA exams we use the `SUBSTRING()` function, the syntax is **SUBSTRING(start, end, string)** and in this case the **end** value is the last index of the string we **do want**! Examples:

  ```python
  subject = "Computer Science"
  SUBSTRING(0, 3, subject)        # returns "Comp"
  SUBSTRING(9, 15, subject)       # returns "Science"
  SUBSTRING(2, 5, "important")    # returns "port"
  ```

  ## Knowledge Check Quiz

  Now check your understanding! All questions use this new variable assignment, hero = "Ada Lovelace"

  ```python
  hero
  +--------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  | Index+ |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10  | 11  |
  +--------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  | Char   |  A  |  d  |  a  |     |  L  |  o  |  v  |  e  |  l  |  a  |  c  |  e  |
  +--------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  | Index- | -12 | -11 | -10 | -9  | -8  | -7  | -6  | -5  | -4  | -3  | -2  | -1  |
  +--------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  ```

            value: '"Ada "'
            explanation: Wrong, the string would be shorter than this.

            value: Love
            explanation: Correct! Index 4 is "L" and index 8 is "l", which we exclude.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: Lovel
            explanation: Close, but Python slicing excludes the character at index 8.

            value: " Lov"
            explanation: No, index 4 is "L", not the space.
          - id: "4"
            value: ace
            explanation: Incorrect slice, this is from the end of the string.

        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: hero[3:4]
            explanation: Correct! Index 3 is the space, and index 4 is "L", which we
              exclude.

            value: hero[3]
            explanation: Correct, we can just specify a single index if we want one
              character.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "4"
            value: hero[-9:-8]
            explanation: Also correct, we can index from the end of the string to the space.

  - id: "5"
    questions:
      - id: "1"

            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "Ada "
            explanation: No, index 3 is the space, which is excluded.
          - id: "3"
            value: Lovelace
            explanation: No, that's from index 4 onward.
          - id: "4"
            value: A
            explanation: Too short, this would be hero[0:1].
