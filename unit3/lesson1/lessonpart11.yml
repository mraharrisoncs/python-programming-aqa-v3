  ## Finding a character


  Sometimes we need to know where a character or substring begins in a larger
  string. For example, if we wanted to split "Ada Lovelace" into first name and
  last name, we could find the space, and split there.


  We can use **`find()`** in Python to do this. The `find()` method searches for
  a substring and returns the **index of its first occurrence**. If the
  substring isn’t found, it returns `-1`.


  Let’s try it with our `hero` string:


  ```python

  >>> hero = "Ada Lovelace"

  >>> space_index = hero.find(" ")

  >>> print(space_index)

  3

  ```


  In the above example the find() function has found a space at position 3
  (remembering to count from zero!) which means the first name ends at index 2,
  and the last name begins at index 4. We can split accordingly now:


  ```python

  >>> first_name = hero[:space_index]

  >>> last_name = hero[space_index + 1:]

  >>> print(first_name)

  >>> print(last_name)

  Ada

  Lovelace

  ```


  This code will work for any string now, splitting into two words at the first
  space, for example:


  ```python

  >>> hero = "Alan Turing"

  >>> space_index = hero.find(" ")

  >>> first_name = hero[:space_index]

  >>> last_name = hero[space_index + 1:]

  >>> print(first_name)

  >>> print(last_name)

  Alan

  Turing

  ```


  ## Finding longer substrings


  We can use find() to find longer substrings, not just single characters. It
  returns the position of the first character in the substring, but only if the
  whole substring is found, for example:


  ```python

  >>> ingredients = "nuts, milk, flour, eggs"

  >>> milk_index = ingredients.find("milk")

  >>> print(milk_index)

  6

  ```


  ## Using "in"


  Sometimes we don't care where the substring starts, we just need to know if it
  exists within the longer string. This is where **`in`** comes in! We can just
  ask Python `substring in longer_string`, which returns a Boolean value:
  **True** if the substring is present, **False** if not. Like this:


  ```python

  >>> ingredients = "nuts, milk, flour, eggs"

  >>> print("milk" in ingredients)

  True

  >>> print("fish" in ingredients)

  False

  ```


  ## Aside - functions v. methods v. operators!


  The different ways we use these string handling features in Python can be a
  little confusing. Let's recap how to use **`len()`**, **`find()`** and
  **`in`**, and explain why the syntax varies so much. Note, You don't need to
  know this bit for GCSE Computer Science, but if you're curious, read on! The
  three syntax styles are:


  ```python

  len(string)             # returns the length of a string

  string.find(substring)  # finds substring in string and returns its position
  or -1 if not found

  substring in string     # looks for substring in string and returns True if
  found else False

  ```


  To find the length of a string we just write len(string), this is a standard
  function call, where the function name is followed by parentheses containing
  the argument, and we can do it because len() is a **built-in function.** 


  However, we place the **find()** function *after* the string variable name,
  dotted like this: **`string.find()`** because find() is a **method**: a
  function that belongs to the string data type, not a **built-in
  function** like len(). Methods are still functions, but they’re attached to
  specific data types or data structures, rather than being part of Python’s
  general toolbox. You access them using **dot notation**, which tells Python,
  “use this function that’s built into this kind of data.” 


  Finally, **in** is an **operator**, this means it sits between two
  **operands** and performs an operation on them both. You may recall `*` and
  `%` are **arithmetic operators**, `==` and `>=` are **comparison operators**,
  well **`in`** is a **membership operator**, it checks whether the left-hand
  operand exists within the right-hand operand. 


  > Tip: to check if a substring is **not** present in a larger string we can
  either negate the result of **in** like this: `not substring in string` or use
  the Python operator `not in` like this, which sounds better when you read it:
  `substring not in string` - only in Python!


  ## Pseudocode notes


  In AQA exams you won't see **find()** or **in** being used, instead we use the
  **POSITION()** pseudocode function, which finds the first occurrence of a
  **single character** in another string. The syntax is POSITION(String, Char).
  Here are some examples:


  ```python

  POSITION('Computer Science', 'm')  # returns 2

  POSITION('Ada Lovelace', ' ')      # returns 3

  ```
