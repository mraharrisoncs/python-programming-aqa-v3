title: Indexing a string
content: |
  Remember our `greeting = "Hello World!"` example? We said that we could break this string into parts called **substrings**. In Python we do that by specifying the  **index position(s)** of the substring we want. Let's take another look at the string:

  ```python
  greeting
  +--------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  | Index  |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10  | 11  |
  +--------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  | Char   |  H  |  e  |  l  |  l  |  o  |     |  W  |  o  |  r  |  l  |  d  |  !  |
  +--------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
  ```

  Every character can be accessed by its index. We use the same syntax as when we index Python lists: square brackets around the index like this:

  ```python
  >>> greeting[0]
  H
  >>> greeting[1]
  e
  >>> greeting[11]
  !
  ```

  Answer these quick questions before we move on, and remember that the first character has index 0!

          What would be the output of this program? 
          greeting = "Hello World!" 
          print(greeting[4])
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: o
            explanation: Yes, the character at index 4 in the string 'Hello World!' is 'o'.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: l
            explanation: No, The character 'l' is at index 2 and 3, not 4. Remember to count
              from zero!
          - id: "3"
            value: H
            explanation: No, The character 'H' is at index 0, not 4.
          - id: "4"
            value: W
            explanation: No, The character 'W' is at index 6, not 4.
  - id: "2"

      - id: "1"

          What must be the missing index in the square brackets if the output is
          'W'? 

          greeting = 'Hello World!' 

          print(greeting[?])
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "6"
            explanation: Yes, The character 'W' is at index 6 in the string 'Hello World!'.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "5"
            explanation: No, At index 5 we can see a space character, not 'W' (count from
              zero remember!)
          - id: "3"
            value: "7"
            explanation: No, At index 7 we can see a "o" character, not 'W' (count from zero
              remember!)
