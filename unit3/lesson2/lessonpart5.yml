title: Programming iteration
content: >+
  Let's try some programming challenges now, using iteration.


  #### 1. Count the vowels


  Open `q1.py` and write a Python program that asks the user for a phrase. The
  program should output the phrase with all vowels in capitals, and all
  consonants in lower case. For example, if the user enters `"Fetch Decode
  Execute"` the output should be `fEtch dEcOdE ExEcUtE`:


  ```

  Phrase?: Fetch Decode Execute

  fEtch dEcOdE ExEcUtE

  ```


  **Hints:**


  * **Iterate over the string**, don't use indexing.


  * Use `... in "aeiou"` to check for vowels.


  * Use `upper()` / `lower()` as appropriate then **concatenate** the changed
  character to an output string.


  * Print the output string after the loop ends.


  ### 3. Show Uppercase Only


  Open `q2.py` and write a program that asks the user for a phrase and prints
  only the **uppercase letters**, in **reverse order**. For example `Ada
  Lovelace` should become `LA`, and `Total RAM Size` becomes `SMART`!


  ```

  Phrase?: Total RAM Size

  SMART

  ```


  **Hints**:


  * Iterate over the string


  * Check to see if each character is the same as its upper() version (or use
  the .isupper() method)


  * If so, concatenate **on the front** of an output variable.
