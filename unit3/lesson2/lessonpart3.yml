title: Programming with upper() and lower()
content: >+
  Let's try some programming challenges now, using what we learned in lesson 1
  plus the new methods `upper()` and `lower()`


  #### 1. Fetch Initials


  Open `q1.py` and write a Python program that asks the user for their first
  name and last name. The program should then output the initials of the user in
  uppercase. For example, if the user answers 'alan' then 'turing' the output
  should be AT like this:


  ```

  First name?: alan

  Last name?: turing

  AT

  ```


  **Hints:**


  * Use the `upper()` method to convert characters to uppercase.


  * Use string indexing to find the initials.


  #### 2. Find and Slice


  Open `q2.py` and write a Python program that asks the user for a **sentence**
  and a **word**. The program should **find** the first occurrence of the word
  in the sentence, ignoring the case of the word, and output the word **in
  uppercase** along with its position in the sentence. If the word is not found,
  output "Word not found". For example:


  ```

  Sentence?: Learning to program teaches you how to THINK!

  Word?: program

  PROGRAM found at position 4


  Sentence?: Learning to program teaches you how to THINK!

  Word?: think

  THINK found at position 39


  Sentence?: Learning to program teaches you how to THINK!

  Word?: code

  CODE not found

  ```


  **Hints:**


  * Use the `find()` method to locate the position of the word, remember that
  `-1` means "not found"


  * Change both Sentence and Word to the same case before doing the comparison.


  * Use the `upper()` method to convert the input word to uppercase.
