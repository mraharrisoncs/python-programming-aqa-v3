title: Iterating over a string
content: >
  ### String data


  Remember from lesson 1 that a string is stored as a sequence of characters,
  each with its own index, like this


  ```python

  greeting

  +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

  |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10  | 11  |

  +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

  |  H  |  e  |  l  |  l  |  o  |     |  W  |  o  |  r  |  l  |  d  |  !  |

  +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

  ```


  Sometimes we want to inspect individual characters, or change them. To do this
  we need to loop through the string, looking at each character in turn. This is
  called **iterating** over the string.


  ### Indexing through a string with range()


  &#x20;


  We know that each character in `greeting` has an index, you can see them
  above, for example, greeting\[0] is "H". We know that the index goes from 0 to
  11. So we can iterate over the string by the index value using range(12) -
  adding 1 because the Python range function excludes the last number.


  ```python

  greeting = "Hello World!"

  for index in range(12):
    print(greeting[index])
  H

  e

  l

  l

  o
   
  W

  o

  r

  l

  d

  !

  ```


  But that **12** is just the length of the string, which we can get from
  len(greeting), so we can **generalise** this program to work with any length
  string:


  ```python

  name = "Ada"

  for index in range(len(name)):
    print(name[index])
  A

  d

  a

  ```


  ### Iterating over a string


  Finally, we can make this program **even simpler** thanks to Python's concept
  of **iterating over a data structure.** Instead of indexing the string using
  **range()**, we can just ask Python to give us each character in turn, by
  **iterating over the string:**


  ```python

  name = "Ada"

  for letter in name:
    print(letter)
  A

  d

  a

  ```


  This simplified version is very useful if we know we are just going to process
  the characters in the string, and we don't need their index values.

questionGroups:
  - id: "1"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: If we have a string variable called message and we want to iterate over
          it using the index, what is the correct Python code for this?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: for index in range(len(message))
            explanation: Yes, this is the indexing method for iterating over a string.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: for index in range(7)
            explanation: No, the identifier is message but the value stored might have a
              different length.
          - id: "3"
            value: for char in message
            explanation: No, the question asks you to iterate using index values.
          - id: "4"
            value: for index in range(len(message) + 1)
            explanation: No, this will increase the index beyond the last character of the
              string by 1.
  - id: "2"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: |-
          What will be the output of this code?
          message = ""
          for char in "Grace":
            message = message + char.lower() + char.upper()
          print(message)
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: gGrRaAcCeE
            explanation: Correct!
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: graceGRACE
            explanation: No, the for loop selects one character at a time
          - id: "3"
            value: eE
            explanation: No, look again at message = message + char.lower() + char.upper()
          - id: "4"
            value: GgRrAaCcEe
            explanation: No, check the order of char.lower() + char.upper()
