title: Iterating over a string
content: >
  ### String data


  Remember from lesson 1 that a string is stored as a sequence of characters,
  each with its own index, like this


  ```python

  greeting

  +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

  |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10  | 11  |

  +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

  |  H  |  e  |  l  |  l  |  o  |     |  W  |  o  |  r  |  l  |  d  |  !  |

  +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

  ```


  Sometimes we want to inspect individual characters, or change them. To do this
  we need to loop through the string, looking at each character in turn. This is
  called **iterating** over the string.


  ### Iterating over a string


  We will look at** `for`** loops in much more detail in Unit 7, but here is a
  quick look at a vital string handling technique. We can ask Python to give us
  each character in turn, by **iterating over the string:**


  ```python

  name = "Ada"

  for letter in name:
    print(letter)
  A

  d

  a

  ```


  Now check your understanding:
questionGroups:
  - id: "1"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: |-
          What will be the output of this code?
          message = ""
          for char in "Grace":
            message = message + char.lower() + char.upper()
          print(message)
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: gGrRaAcCeE
            explanation: Correct!
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: graceGRACE
            explanation: No, the for loop selects one character at a time
          - id: "3"
            value: eE
            explanation: No, look again at message = message + char.lower() + char.upper()
          - id: "4"
            value: GgRrAaCcEe
            explanation: No, check the order of char.lower() + char.upper()
