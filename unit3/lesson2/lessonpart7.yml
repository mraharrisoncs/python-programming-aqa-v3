title: Python practical - string handling 2
content: >+
  ## Putting it all together, again!


  You are now ready to tackle even more programming challenges using the string
  handling features you have learned.


  Open the attached Python files and try the challenges below.


  1. Password checker - improved. Use the skeleton code in **q1.py**. Add code
  to check the entered password is eight characters or longer, AND contains both
  upper and lowercase characters. Hints: you can use `char = char.upper()` or
  `char.isupper()`.

  2. Password generator. Using **q2.py**, complete the code to generate a random
  password of 12 characters, where the first eight are just letters, and the
  final four are numbers or special characters with ASCII codes from 35 (`#`) to
  57 (`9`), for example xcYlnqdd7%3#.

  3. Vowel counter. Using **q3.py**, complete the code to count the number of
  vowels in an input string. Vowels are "aeiou".

  4. Hash generator. Complete **q4.py** to create a numeric "hash value" in the
  range 0-99 from an input string, by adding all the ASCII codes of the
  characters in the string, then taking the modulus 100. Hint: use `ord()` to
  get the ASCII code, and `%` at the end to take the modulus.

  5. Caesar Cipher. Starting with **q5.py** input a string and a shift value.
  Change the input to all lower case, then encipher (encrypt) the input string
  by shifting the letters down the alphabet by the shift entered. For example,
  if the user enters `cat` and `5` the output should be `hfy`. Remember to wrap
  around to the start of the alphabet if you go beyond z! Hints: use ord() to
  get the ASCII code, then add the shift to this, if you go beyond ord('z') then
  subtract 26, then use chr() to turn back into a letter.
