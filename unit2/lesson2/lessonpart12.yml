  Using the skeleton code provided, solve these problems:


  ### 1. Shopping Bill


  Complete the code in **q1.py**. Input the prices of three items.\

  Calculate the total and output it.


  ***


  ### 2. Weekly Pay


  Using **q2.py**, input the hourly pay rate and hours worked.\

  Calculate the weekly gross pay by multiplying hourly pay rate by hours
  worked.\

  Then take off 20% for tax (or calculate 80% of the gross value, which is the
  same thing) to get net pay.\

  **Example:** If hourly rate is £14.00 and hours worked is 20, then net pay is
  £224.00.


  ***


  ### 3. Movie Duration


  Write a function in **q3.py** that takes the length of a movie in
  minutes. Calculate the duration in hours and minutes.\

  Return a string in the format `hours:minutes`.


  ***


  ### 4. Loan Interest


  Using **q4.py**, input the amount borrowed, the annual interest rate (as a
  percentage), and the number of years elapsed. Calculate simple interest using
  the formula:\

  `interest = (amount × rate × years) / 100`\

  Output the interest rounded to 2 decimal places.


  ***


  ### 5. Energy Bill


  In **q5.py**, input the cost per unit and units used for both cheap rate and
  peak rate. Calculate the cost for each rate using:\

  `cost = units × rate`\

  Add both costs to get the total bill. Round the result to 2 decimal places.\

  **Example:** `(0.15 × 245) + (0.49 × 180) = £124.95`
