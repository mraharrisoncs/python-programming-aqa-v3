title: Python debugging exercise 4
content: >+
  Our final quick-fire debugging exercise before you fly solo!


  This program attempts to input scores repeatedly until the user enters
  **-1** which should end the loop, and calculate and display the average score.
  But there are many errors in the code. Can you spot and fix them all?


  Open the Python file and complete these tasks:


  1. Spot the error(s) in the code

  2. Decide whether each is a Syntax, Logical, or Runtime error

  3. Predict the outcome of attempting to run the code

  4. Fix the code and test it
     Then answer the questions below.
