  ### Capstone Project - Change Calculator


  # 💰⛃⛂⛁⛀💸


  You are programming the coin dispenser in a vending machine. Write a function
  to calculate the quantity and value of each coin needed to give correct
  change. 


  Available coins: £1 (100p), 50p, 20p, 10p, 5p, 2p, 1p.


  **Example input:** £3.48


  **Example output:** `3 × £1, 2 × 20p, 1 × 5p, 1 × 2p, 1 × 1p`


  *Hint:* Convert input to pence, then use // (DIV) to decide how many times 100
  goes into the amount - this is the £1 coins needed - and then use % (MOD) to
  calculate the remainder. Repeat this for every coin value!
