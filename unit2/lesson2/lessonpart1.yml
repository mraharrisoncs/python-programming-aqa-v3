  ### Retrieval Practice Questions


  1. **What is the result of** **`7 + 3 * 2`** **in Python?**

     * Consider the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when evaluating this expression.

  2. **Write a Python expression to divide 45 by 2 and round down to the nearest
  integer.**

     * Use a single arithmetic operator, and no functions, ensuring the result is an integer.

  3. **What does** **`2 ** 3`** **evaluate to?**

     * Recall what the `**` operator does in Python.

  4. **Which operator would you use to find the remainder of 10 divided by 3?**

     * Identify the operator that provides the remainder of a division operation.

  - id: "1"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What is the result of 7 + 3 * 2 in Python?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "13"
            explanation: The multiplication is performed first, so 3 * 2 = 6, then 7 + 6 =
              13.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "20"
            explanation: Wrong because this adds 7 and 3 first, ignoring the order of
              operations.
          - id: "3"
            value: "16"
            explanation: Wrong, did you calculate 3 ** 2 (3 squared) instead of 3 * 2 (3 ×
              2)?
          - id: "4"
            value: "12"
            explanation: Wrong, did you calculate 7 + 3 + 2?
  - id: "2"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Write a Python expression to divide 45 by 2 and round down to the
          nearest integer. Use a single arithmetic operator, and no functions to
          achieve the result.
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: 45 // 2
            explanation: The '//' operator performs floor division, rounding down to the
              nearest integer.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: 45 / 2
            explanation: The '/' operator performs true division, resulting in a float.
          - id: "3"
            value: int(45 / 2)
            explanation: This converts the result to an integer but uses a function, not a
              single arithmetic operator.
          - id: "4"
            value: round(45 / 2)
            explanation: The 'round' function rounds to the nearest integer, not necessarily
              down, and the question required no use of functions.
  - id: "3"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What does 2 ** 3 evaluate to?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "8"
            explanation: Correct because 2 ** 3 means 2 raised to the power of 3 (2 cubed).
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "6"
            explanation: Wrong because it's the result of 2 * 3 (2 × 3) not exponentiation.
          - id: "3"
            value: "9"
            explanation: Wrong because 2 ** 3 is not the same as 3 squared.
          - id: "4"
            value: "5"
            explanation: Incorrect because this is the result of 2 + 3 not 2 ** 3.
  - id: "4"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Which operator would you use to find the remainder of 10 divided by 3?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "%"
            explanation: "The % operator (modulus) is used to find the remainder like this:
              10 % 3."
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: //
            explanation: This is integer or 'floor' division, not remainder.
          - id: "3"
            value: /
            explanation: The / operator is used for division, not for finding the remainder.
          - id: "4"
            value: "**"
            explanation: This is exponentiation, not finding the remainder.
