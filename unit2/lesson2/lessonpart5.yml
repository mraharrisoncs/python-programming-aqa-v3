title: Python debugging exercise 1
content: >
  Open the Python file and complete these tasks


  1. Find the line where the error is

  2. Decide whether it is a Syntax or Logical error

  3. Predict the outcome of attempting to run the code (will it just not run,
  will it run and stop, what error will be reported?)

  4. Fix the code and test it.


  Then answer the questions below.

        content: On which line is the error?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "4"
            explanation: Correct, there is a stray minus sign causing Python to expect
              another value at the end.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "3"
            explanation: Wrong, this line is syntactically correct
          - id: "3"
            value: "2"
            explanation: Wrong, this line is syntactically correct
          - id: "4"
            value: "5"
            explanation: Wrong, this line is syntactically correct
  - id: "2"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Is this a logical or syntax error?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Logical
            explanation: Wrong, the logic is correct (if the error is dealt with)
          - id: "2"
            value: Syntax
            explanation: Correct, the program breaks the rules of Python which is a syntax
              error.
            isCorrect: true

        content: "Predict: what will happen if we try to run the code?"
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: The program won't start
            explanation: Correct, a syntax error prevents the program starting
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: The program will start and fail at line 3
            explanation: Wrong, a syntax error prevents the program running
          - id: "3"
            value: The program will complete but with unexpected results
            explanation: Wrong, a syntax error prevents the program running
  - id: "4"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: How can we fix this program without changing the programmer's
          intention?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Remove the stray minus sign
            explanation: Correct
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: Place a constant after the minus sign
            explanation: Wrong, this would fix the syntax error but change the result
          - id: "3"
            value: Change the minus sign to a plus sign
            explanation: Wrong, this would not resolve the syntax error
