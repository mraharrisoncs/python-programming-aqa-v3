  This program attempts to convert temperature values in Fahrenheit to Celsius,
  but it contains errors The correct process for this is "subtract 32, then
  multiply by five-ninths".


  Open the Python file and complete these tasks:


  ## PRIMM Activities


  1. 🤔 **Predict:** what the code will do.

  2. ▶️ **Run** and check your prediction.

  3. 🔍**Investigate:** spot the error(s) in the code and decide whether each is
  a Syntax, Logical, or Runtime error

  4. ✏️**Modify:** Fix the code and test it, then answer the questions below.

  5. 🛠️ **Make:** write a new function **`c_to_f`** to convert Celsius
  temperatures to Fahrenheit.

        type: choice
        content: What is the first error in this program?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: The formula uses ** instead of *
            explanation: Correct, ** is exponentiation, not multiplication
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: The formula uses / instead of //
            explanation: Wrong, / is correct for decimal division
          - id: "3"
            value: The return statement is missing
            explanation: Wrong, the return statement is present

    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What is the second error in this program?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Missing brackets around (fahrenheit - 32)
            explanation: Correct, without brackets Python evaluates operations in the wrong
              order
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: The function name is invalid
            explanation: Wrong, the function name is fine
          - id: "3"
            value: The subtraction uses the wrong operator
            explanation: Wrong, the minus sign is correct

        content: What type of error does this cause?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Logical Error
            explanation: Correct, the program runs but gives incorrect results
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: Syntax Error
            explanation: Wrong, the syntax is valid
          - id: "3"
            value: Runtime Error
            explanation: Wrong, the program does not crash

    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What is the correct formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9
            explanation: Correct, this applies the correct order of operations
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: fahrenheit - 32 * 5 / 9
            explanation: Wrong, this multiplies before subtracting
          - id: "3"
            value: fahrenheit - (32 * 5 / 9)
            explanation: Wrong, this subtracts a constant (roughly 17.8 every time!) instead
              of scaling the difference
