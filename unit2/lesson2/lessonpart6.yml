content: |
  Open the Python file and complete these tasks:
  1. Spot the error(s) in the code
  2. Decide whether each is a Syntax or Logical error
  3. Predict the outcome of attempting to run the code
  4. Fix the code and test it
  Then answer the questions below.

    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What is the error in this program?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: The multiplication uses `x` instead of `*`
            explanation: Correct, Python expects `*` for multiplication, not `x`
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: The variable `area` is undefined
            explanation: Wrong, `area` is defined, but the expression is invalid
          - id: "3"
            value: The print statement is missing a closing bracket
            explanation: Wrong, the print syntax is correct
  - id: "2"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What type of error is this?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Syntax Error
            explanation: Correct, Python reads `x` as a variable and throws a syntax error
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: Logical Error
            explanation: Wrong, the program won't run at all
          - id: "3"
            value: Runtime Error
            explanation: Wrong, the error is detected before execution
  - id: "3"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What will happen when you try to run the original code?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: The program won't start
            explanation: Correct, Python throws a syntax error and halts
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "It prints `Area: 21`"
            explanation: Wrong, the code doesn't reach the print statement
          - id: "3"
            value: "It prints `Area: x`"
            explanation: Wrong, `x` is not defined and causes a syntax error
  - id: "4"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: How should the code be fixed?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Replace `x` with `*`
            explanation: Correct, `*` is the proper multiplication operator in Python
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: Add quotation marks around `x`
            explanation: Wrong, that would make it a string, not an operator
          - id: "3"
            value: Change `print` to `print()`
            explanation: Wrong, the print syntax is already correct
