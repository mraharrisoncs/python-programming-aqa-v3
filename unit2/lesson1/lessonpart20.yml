title: Operator precedence - BIDMAS
content: >
  When evaluating an expression, Python - like all programming languages -
  follows the rules of arithmetic, including the **operator precedence** rule,
  often called BIDMAS or BODMAS:


  * **BIDMAS**: Brackets, Indices, Division\*, Multiplication, Addition,
  Subtraction


  * **BODMAS**: Brackets, Orders, Division\*, Multiplication, Addition,
  Subtraction


  *\*Division includes Real Division (/), Integer Division (//) and Modulus (%)*


  We evaluate operations in this order, remembering that **Division and
  Multiplication** have equal precedence, as do **Addition and Subtraction.**
  Operations are evaluated **left to right** if they have **equal** precedence.


  For example


  ```python

  >>> 7 + 2 * 4

  15

  ```


  In this example, 2 \* 4 is evaluated first to get 8, then we evaluate 7 + 8,
  and get the result 15.


  ```python

  >>> 8 * 3 / (2 + 4)

  4.0

  ```


  Here we evaluate the **brackets** first, 2 + 4 = 6. Then we are left with
  multiplication and division, which have **equal** precedence, so we just work
  left to right, evaluating 8 \* 3 / 6 which results in **4.0** (note that the
  divide operation always returns a **float** in Python).


  ```python

  >>> 16 / 2 ** (12 / 4)

  2.0

  ```


  Python evaluates this expression in this order using BIDMAS:


  1. Brackets first: 12 / 4 = 3

  2. Then Indices (Exponentiation or Order): 2 \*\* 3 = 8

  3. Finally, Division: 16 / 8 = 2.0 (remembering the result will always be a
  real or **float** after real division).


  Now evaluate this expression and choose the correct answer:
questionGroups:
  - id: "1"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: 2 ** (6 - 2 * 4)
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "65536"
            explanation: Wrong, you may have done 6 - 2 = 4, then 4 * 4 = 16, then 2 ** 16 =
              65536. But multiplication should be done before subtraction inside
              the brackets
          - id: "2"
            value: "0.25"
            explanation: Correct, 2 ** (6 - 8) = 2 ** (-2) = 1/4 = 0.25
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "3"
            value: "56"
            explanation: >
              Wrong, you may have evaluated 2 ** 6 - (2 * 4), giving 64 - 8 =
              56.  But the brackets must be resolved first.
          - id: "4"
            value: "64"
            explanation: Wrong, this is the result of 2 ** (6 - 2) * 4. But the original
              brackets include the multiplication,  so you should have done 2 *
              4 first.
