  We used the operators //, % and \*\* in questions on the last page:, like
  this:


  ```python

  11 // 4  = 2

  11 % 4   = 3

  6 ** 2   = 36

  ```

    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Which Python operator performs "Integer Division", also called
          "Quotient" and having the pseudocode keyword DIV? This operation
          returns the whole number result of a division, excluding the
          remainder.
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: /
            explanation: Wrong, / gives a float result (standard division)
          - id: "2"
            value: //
            explanation: Correct, // gives the whole number part of division
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "3"
            value: "%"
            explanation: Wrong, % gives the remainder (MOD)
          - id: "4"
            value: "**"
            explanation: Wrong, ** is the exponentiation operator
  - id: "2"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: Which Python operator performs "Modulus", also called "Modulo" and
          having the pseudocode keyword MOD? This operation returns the
          remainder of a division operation.
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: /
            explanation: Wrong, / is standard division
          - id: "2"
            value: //
            explanation: Wrong, // gives the whole number part of division
          - id: "3"
            value: "%"
            explanation: Correct, % gives the remainder after division
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "4"
            value: "**"
            explanation: Wrong, ** is the exponentiation operator
  - id: "3"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: multiple
        content: The ** operator performs "Exponential" or "raise to the power of".
          Which of these are correct evaluations? Tick all that are correct.
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: 6 ** 2 = 36
            explanation: Correct, 6 squared is 36
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: 2 ** 3 = 4
            explanation: Wrong, 2 ** 3 is 8 (2 x 2 x 2)
          - id: "3"
            value: 3 ** 3 = 27
            explanation: Correct, 3 cubed is 27
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "4"
            value: 4 ** 3 = 64
            explanation: Correct, 4 cubed is 64
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "5"
            value: 5 ** 5 = 25
            explanation: Wrong, 5 to the power 5 is 3125 (not 25)
