title: Python practical - basic arithmetic
content: >+
  The same program in Python would look like this:

  ```python

  x = 10

  y = 5

  z = x + y

  print(z)

  ```

  * Open the Python program on the right, run and check the output is as
  expected.

  * Change the values of x and y and try again.

  * Try different operators (+, -, \*, /).

          you would write z = x * y in your Maths exercise book.
