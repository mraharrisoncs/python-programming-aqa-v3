title: Pseudocode example - modulus
content: >
  Modulus (or modulo) finds the remainder.


  ```

  result ← 7 MOD 2

  OUTPUT result

  ```


  The output from the above algorithm would be **1**, because 7 divided by 2
  gives 3 **remainder 1**.


  ```

  result ← 8 MOD 2

  OUTPUT result

  ```


  The output from the above algorithm would be **0,** because there is **no
  remainder** after dividing 8 by 2.

        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "0"
            explanation: Any number multiplied by 3 and then divided by 3 has no remainder.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "1"
            explanation: 1 cannot be the remainder when you divide 3n by 3.
          - id: "3"
            value: "2"
            explanation: 2 cannot be the remainder when you divide 3n by 3.
