title: Common misconceptions and confusions

  **Confusing the division operators**


  Be careful not to confuse real division (/) with integer division (DIV or //).
  Real division results in a real number, or floating-point number, with a
  fractional part if necessary. Integer division discards this fractional part
  and returns just the integer part. For example, 7 divided by 2 is 3.5, while 7
  DIV 2 is just the integer 3.


  ```

  >>> 7 / 2   

  3.5


  >>> 7 // 2

  3

  ```


  **Confusing DIV (//) and MOD (%)**


  Both of these operators are probably new to you. Be careful not to confuse
  them. DIV (//) performs a kind of division, that's why the pseudocode is DIV
  and the Python symbol uses two division signs.


  MOD is modulo, or remainder. The symbol used in Python is the ASCII percentage
  sign, simply because it looks a bit like a division sign with extra bits! (It
  was chosen for modulo in the C language way back in the 1970s and it's too
  late to change it now!)&#x20;


  7 divided by 2 gives the **result 3** and **remainder 1**, so 7 DIV 2 is the
  result 3, while 7 MOD 2 is the remainder 1. Here's how that would look in the
  Python Shell:


  ```python

  >>> 7 // 2

  3


  >>> 7 % 2

  1

  ```


  Just remember that the % sign in Python code is the modulo or remainder, not
  actually a percentage operation!
