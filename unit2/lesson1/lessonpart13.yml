title: Python example - division
content: >
  Python uses "/" for real division, and "//" for integer division (floor
  division). Here are those examples again in Python syntax:


  ```python

  result = 7 / 2

  print(result)


  result = 7 // 2

  print(result)

  ```


  Try this code now in the sample program, or enter the expressions directly
  into the REPL. Then change the operands and see what happens.

          algorithm?
