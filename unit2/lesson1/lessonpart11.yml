title: Division and Modulus
content: >
  Real Division (/): Performs division and returns a **floating-point integer**

  Integer Division (DIV or //): Performs division and **discards the remainder**
  returning an **integer**

  Modulus (MOD or %): Returns **the remainder** after division

  Example operations and their results.


  ```python

  >>> 9 / 2   

  4.5   

  >>> 9 // 2   

  4   

  >>> 9 % 2   

  1

  ```


  Now calculate these expressions in your head. Use the REPL if stuck!

        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "4"
            explanation: Correct, 14 // 3 performs integer division and discards the
              remainder
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "4.66666666667"
            explanation: Wrong, this is the result of real division (14 / 3)
          - id: "3"
            value: "2"
            explanation: Wrong, this is unrelated to either division or modulus for 14 and 3

        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "4"
            explanation: Wrong, 14 % 3 gives the remainder, which is 2
          - id: "2"
            value: "4.66666666667"
            explanation: Wrong, this is the result of real division (14 / 3)
          - id: "3"
            value: "2"
            explanation: Correct, 14 % 3 returns the remainder after division
