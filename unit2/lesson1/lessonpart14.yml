title: Modulus operation in more detail
content: >+
  The **Modulus** operation, which uses the **Modulus** or
  **Modulo** operator...


  * has the pseudocode keyword MOD and the Python symbol %


  * calculates the remainder after division


  For example, 10 MOD 3 returns 1, or in Python:


  ```python

  >>> 10 % 3

  1

  ```


  This is because after dividing 10 by 3, there is a remainder 1.


  Modulus has many uses:


  * Check if number is even/odd, or divisible by another number


  * Calculate time in hours, minutes, seconds from a single count value e.g.
  seconds.


  * Generate hash values within a given range, e.g. to store keys in a hash
  table.

      - id: "1"
        type: multiple
        content: Which of these would be best achieved with the MOD operator?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Checking if a number is even or odd
            explanation: The MOD operator can determine if a number is even or odd by
              checking the remainder when divided by 2.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: Calculating the square root of a number
            explanation: The MOD operator is not used for calculating square roots; it is
              used for finding remainders.
          - id: "3"
            value: Generating hash values within the range 0 to 999
            explanation: Yes, performing n MOD 1000 would result in a number between 0 and
              999.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "4"
            value: Sorting a list of numbers
            explanation: The MOD operator is not used for sorting; it is used for remainder
              calculations.
