        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "True"
            explanation: Correct, 10 is divisible by 2, so the remainder is 0.

        content: What is the result of 5 // 2?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "1"
            explanation: Wrong, 5 % 2 = 1, did you calculate the modulus by mistake?
          - id: "2"
            value: "2"
            explanation: Correct, integer division of 5 by 2 gives 2.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "3"
            value: "2.5"
            explanation: Wrong, this is the result of real division (5 / 2).
          - id: "4"
            value: "3"
            explanation: Wrong, 5 // 2 is less than 3, did you do 5 - 2?
  - id: "3"
    questions:

          - id: "2"
            value: "11"
            explanation: Correct, 4 * 2 = 8, then 3 + 8 = 11.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "3"
            value: "9"
            explanation: Wrong, this result doesn’t match any valid order.
          - id: "4"
            value: "19"

    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What is the exact result of 8 / 2 in Python?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "6.0"
            explanation: Wrong, 8 / 2 is not 6.0
          - id: "2"
            value: "4"
            explanation: Wrong, Python returns a float with a decimal part from real
              division, even if the decimal part is zero!
          - id: "3"
            value: "4.0"
            explanation: Correct, Python's / operator returns a float, in this case 4.0
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "4"
            value: "0"
            explanation: Wrong, 8 / 2 is not zero
  - id: "5"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What is the result of 19 % 5 ?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "3"
            explanation: Wrong, this would be 19 // 5 (integer division)
          - id: "2"
            value: "3.8"
            explanation: Wrong, modulus returns an integer, not a float.
          - id: "3"
            value: "4"
            explanation: Correct, 5 goes into 19 three times with a remainder of 4.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "4"
