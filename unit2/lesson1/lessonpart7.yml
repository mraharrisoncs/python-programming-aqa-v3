title: Exponential
content: >+
  An **exponential** is an expression that includes **raising a number to the
  power of another number**.


  This process is known as **exponentiation** or "raising x **to the power of**
  y".


  **Exponentiation** is multiplying a **base** by itself a number of times, as
  specified by the **exponent**.


  For example, 2 raised to the power of 3 (written 2³) means 2 multiplied by
  itself three times:


  > **2³ = 2 \* 2 \* 2 = 8**
