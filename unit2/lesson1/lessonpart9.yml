  The same program in Python would look like this:


  ```python

  y = 2

  result = 3 ** y

  print(result) 

  ```


  Open the Python program, run it and check the output. Change the integer
  values in the program and check the result.


  Change line 2 to:


  ```python

  result = x ** y

  ```


  and add this at the top


  ```python

  x = 3

  ```


  Now what happens?

          What happens when you set y = 0? 
          y = -1 ? 
          y = 0.5 ?
