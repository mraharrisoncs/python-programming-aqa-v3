title: Key terms
content: >+
  **Operator:** a symbol for an operation such as +, -, \*, /, //, %, \*\*  


  **Operand:** the terms either side of the operator, for example 3 and 4 in **3
  + 4**


  **Integer:** a whole number such as **7, -1**


  **Float (floating-point):** a number with a decimal part, also called
  **Real**, such as **4.0, 3.14, 9.999999**


  **Expression**: Any valid combination of terms and operators that can be
  evaluated, e.g. 


  * 1 + 2


  * 14 / 3


  * (num / 7) \*\* 2

      - id: "1"
        type: choice
        content: What is the operator in the expression 12 // 5 ?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "12"
            explanation: Wrong, this is the first operand, not the operator
          - id: "2"
            value: "5"
            explanation: Wrong, this is the second operand
          - id: "3"
            value: //
            explanation: Correct, // is the floor division operator
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "4"
            value: /
            explanation: Wrong, this is regular division, not floor division
  - id: "2"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: multiple
        content: What are the two operands in the expression 12 // 5 ? Tick both.
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: /
            explanation: Wrong, this is an operator, not an operand (and it's not in the
              expression anyway!)
          - id: "2"
            value: //
            explanation: Wrong, this is the operator in the expression, not an operand
          - id: "3"
            value: "12"
            explanation: Correct, 12 is the first operand
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "4"
            value: "5"
            explanation: Correct, 5 is the second operand
            isCorrect: true
  - id: "3"
    questions:
      - id: "1"
        type: multiple
        content: Which of these are integers? Select all.
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "3"
            explanation: Correct, 3 is a whole number
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "3.1"
            explanation: Wrong, 3.1 is a decimal, not an integer
          - id: "3"
            value: "0"
            explanation: Correct, 0 is an integer
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "4"
            value: "-4"
            explanation: Correct, negative whole numbers are still integers
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "5"
            value: "-0.4"
            explanation: Wrong, this is a negative decimal, not an integer
