  ### Worked Examples with if-elif-else


  In this section, we'll explore how to use the `if-elif-else` structure in
  Python with some practical examples. This structure allows us to execute
  different blocks of code based on certain conditions.


  #### Example 1: Date-Related Decision


  Let's create a simple program that checks the day of the week and prints a
  message based on whether it's a weekday or the weekend.


  ```python

  import datetime


  # Get the current day of the week

  current_day = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%A")


  if current_day in ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"]:
      print("It's a weekday. Time to work or study!")
  elif current_day == "Saturday":
      print("It's Saturday! Enjoy your weekend!")
  else:
      print("It's Sunday! Relax and recharge for the week ahead.")
  ```


  **Explanation:**


  * We use the `datetime` module to get the current day of the week.


  * The `if` statement checks if the day is a weekday.


  * The `elif` statement checks if it's Saturday.


  * The `else` statement handles the case for Sunday.


  #### Example 2: Menu System for a Food Ordering App


  Here's a simple menu function that allows someone to order a meal. The menu is
  organised into starters, main courses and desserts!


  ```python

  def menu():
    # Display menu
    print("Welcome, choose a category:")
    print("1. Starters")
    print("2. Main Courses")
    print("3. Desserts")

    # Get user choice and call function 
    choice = int(input("Choice (1-3)? "))
    if choice == 1:
        starter_menu()
    elif choice == 2:
        maincourse_menu()
    elif choice == 3:
        dessert_menu()
    else:
        print("Invalid choice")
    return
  ```


  **Explanation:**


  * The program displays a menu with three options.


  * The user inputs their choice, which is then checked using `if-elif-else`.


  * Each condition corresponds to a menu option, and the `else` statement
  handles invalid inputs.


  #### Example 3: Playlist Selector Based on Mood


  This example demonstrates a simple playlist selector that suggests a playlist
  based on the user's mood.


  ```python

  # Ask the user for their mood

  mood = input("How are you feeling today? (happy, sad, energetic, relaxed):
  ").lower()


  if mood == "happy":
      print("Here's a playlist to keep you smiling: 'Feel Good Hits'")
  elif mood == "sad":
      print("Here's a playlist to lift your spirits: 'Cheer Up Tunes'")
  elif mood == "energetic":
      print("Here's a playlist to keep you moving: 'Workout Jams'")
  elif mood == "relaxed":
      print("Here's a playlist to help you unwind: 'Chill Vibes'")
  else:
      print("Sorry, I don't have a playlist for that mood. Try 'Mixed Emotions'!")
  ```


  **Explanation:**


  * The user inputs their mood, which is converted to lowercase to ensure
  consistent comparison.


  * The `if-elif-else` structure checks the mood and suggests a corresponding
  playlist.


  * The `else` statement provides a default playlist if the mood doesn't match
  any predefined options.
