title: Python practical - if-elif-else
content: >
  ## Using if-elif-else


  ### 1. School phase?


  Starting with the code in **q1.py**, write a function that accepts an integer
  parameter representing a student's age in years and returns which school phase
  they are in. If under 11 they are in 'Primary', between 11 and 16 inclusive:
  'Secondary', over 16: 'Sixth Form'.


  ### 2. Pizza discount?


  A pizza restaurant offers discounts based on the following rules:


  * Customers with a **filled loyalty card** get **15% off**.


  * If they don't have a filled loyalty card but do have a **student card**,
  they get **10% off**, **but only on weekdays**.


  * If neither of the above is true, but the customer is **over 65**, they get
  **5% off**.


  * Otherwise, they pay full price.


  A Python function has been partially written in **q2.py**. This takes five
  parameters:


  * the original price of the order: float


  * whether they have a filled loyalty card: Boolean


  * whether they have a student card: Boolean


  * the day of the week e.g. "Mon": string


  * their age in years : integer


  Complete this function with an **`if-elif-else`** code block that implements
  the discount rules correctly, and returns the amended price.
