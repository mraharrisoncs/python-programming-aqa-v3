  ### Understanding if-elif-else


  In Python, the `if-elif-else` statement is a powerful tool for
  decision-making. It allows you to check multiple conditions and execute
  different blocks of code based on which condition is true. This is
  particularly useful when you have more than two possible outcomes. Consider
  this function that returns a grade based on the score passed in as a
  parameter. 


  ```python

  def grade(score):
    if score >= 80:
      return 'A'
    else:
      if score >= 60
        return 'B'
      else:
        if score >= 40
          return 'C'
        else:
          return 'F'
  ```


  After the first conditional, we have nested each if statement in the
  **else** branch of the previous one. This works, but it's really messy, and
  the indentation is out of control! Fortunately, Python gives us an easier way
  to do this. The **elif** statement is short for **else if**, and the above
  function can be simplified like this:


  ```python

  def grade(score):
    if score >= 80:
      return 'A'
    elif score >= 60
      return 'B'
    elif score >= 40
      return 'C'
    else:
      return 'F'
  ```


  ### Syntax of if-elif-else


  The general syntax of an `if-elif-else` statement is as follows:


  ```python

  if condition1:
      # Code to execute if condition1 is true
  elif condition2:
      # Code to execute if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
  elif condition3:
      # Code to execute if condition1 and condition2 are false and condition3 is true
  '''

  add more elif branches as necessary here

  '''

  else:
      # Code to execute if none of the above conditions are true
  ```


  * **`if`**: The initial condition to check. If this condition is true, the
  corresponding block of code is executed.


  * **`elif`**: Short for "else if," this allows you to check additional
  conditions if the previous ones are false.


  * **`else`**: The block of code that runs if none of the preceding conditions
  are true.


  ### Example: Weather Advice


  Here's another example that provides advice based on the weather:


  ```python

  weather = "rainy"


  if weather == "sunny":
      print("Wear sunglasses!")
  elif weather == "rainy":
      print("Take an umbrella!")
  elif weather == "snowy":
      print("Wear a warm coat!")
  else:
      print("Check the weather forecast!")
  ```
