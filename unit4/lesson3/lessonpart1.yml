  ### Introduction to Nested IF Statements


  Remember the party decision program?


  ```python

  if room_tidy and homework_done:
      print("go to party")
  ```


  We could have written this as two separate if statements, one inside the
  other. This is called **nesting** if statements.


  ```python

  if room_tidy:
      if homework_done:
          print("go to party")
  ```


  When the above program runs, Python first checks the value of `room_tidy`, and
  if this is True, it executes the second `if` statement. This then checks the
  Boolean `homework_done`. If this is also True, it prints "go to party". The
  behaviour is identical to the first version that used `and` to make a compound
  condition.


  In Python, nested if statements allow you to check multiple conditions within
  another condition. This is useful when you need to make decisions based on
  more than one criterion. A nested **if** is simply an **if** statement inside
  another **if** statement.


  ### Syntax of Nested IF


  Here's the general structure of a nested if statement:


  ```python

  if condition1:
      # Executes when condition1 is true
      if condition2:
          # Executes when condition2 is true
          print("Both conditions are true")
      else:
          # Executes when condition2 is false
          print("Condition1 is true, but condition2 is false")
  else:
      # Executes when condition1 is false
      print("Condition1 is false")
  ```


  ### Example 1: test scores


  Let's write a nested if statement to determine if a student has passed a
  course based on their test score and attendance. A passing score is 50, and
  the student must have attended at least 75% of classes.


  ```python

  if score >= 50:
      if attendance >= 75:
          print("You passed the course!")
      else:
          print("Your test score was good but your attendance was too low")
  else:
      print("Your test score was too low")
  ```


  ### Indenting


  Remember that Python uses indenting to show where a code block starts and
  ends. In the above example, the inner **if** statement is indented by four
  spaces to show that it is inside the outer if statement. Within this indented
  block you **must** continue to indent the code correctly, hence the inner
  **if** statement branches are indented just as they would be if they were not
  nested within the outer statement.


  ### Example 2: checking card validity


  Remember the ticket barrier function? Maybe we want to improve it to return a
  message instead of just True or False. We would split the condition into
  nested ifs, and then instead of returning True or False we would return an
  appropriate message like this:


  ```python

  def check_smartcard(card_valid, card_balance, time_of_day_hh):
    if card_valid:
       if card_balance >= 1.00 
          if not (time_of_day_hh <= 9)
            return "you may travel"
          else:
            return "you may not travel before 9am"
        else:
          return "balance less than 1.00"
    else:
      return "card invalid"
  ```


  ### Compound conditions vs. nested ifs


  We saw how **and** and **or** allow join conditions together on a single
  **if** statement. So why would you ever need nested ifs? Because they give us
  more control. We can have multiple branches of code and execute each one
  conditionally. The original ticket barrier function only returned True or
  False. The new version allows us to return individual messages for each
  condition.
