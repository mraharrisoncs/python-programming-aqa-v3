title: Programming with match/case
content: >+
  ### Worked Example 1: Categorising Grades


  In this example, we'll use the `match/case` statement to categorise grades
  from A to D into Distinction, Merit, Pass, and Fail. Here is a function that
  takes the parameter **grade** and returns a string containing the category:


  ```python

  def categorize_grade(grade):
      match grade:
          case 'A':
              return "Distinction"
          case 'B':
              return "Merit"
          case 'C':
              return "Pass"
          case 'D':
              return "Fail"
          case _:
              return "Invalid grade"
  ```


  ### Worked Example 2: Handling Multiple Conditions with | 


  In this example, we'll use the `match/case` statement with the `|` operator to
  handle multiple conditions. Let's consider a scenario where we categorize
  weather observations into "Good", "Moderate" or "Bad":


  ```python

  def categorize_weather(observation):
      match observation:
          case 'Sunny' | 'Clear':
              return "Good weather"
          case 'Cloudy' | 'Overcast':
              return "Moderate weather"
          case 'Rainy' | 'Stormy':
              return "Bad weather"
          case _:
              return "Unknown"
  ```


  ## PRIMM activities


  Using the attached **grades.py**:


  1. **🤔 Predict** what the program does.

  2. ▶️ **Run** and check your prediction, were you correct?

  3. 🔍 **Investigate:** why does a grade "E" or "z" return "Invalid grade"? 

  4. ✏️ **Modify:** Change the program so that "D" returns a "Level 1 Pass" and
  "E" and "F" both return a "Fail".

  5. 🛠️ **Make:** a new function that is the reverse of this one, turning
  "Distinction" into "A" etc.
