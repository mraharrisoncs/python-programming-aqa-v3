  ## Pseudocode notes on selection


  Remember, AQA do not require our candidates to use Python, and some schools
  use other languages whose keywords are different. This is why you will see our
  pseudocode in exam papers, not Python. For simplicity and compatibility with
  many languages, we do not have equivalents of `elif` or `match/case` in our
  pseudocode, only `IF-THEN-ELSE`. 


  Complex conditional statements will be represented in exams with nested
  `IF` statements, rather than `if-elif-else` or `match-case` statements. Here
  is the basic structure of a nested `IF`, written in AQA pseudocode.


  ```python

  IF BoolExp THEN
    # statements here
  ELSE
    IF BoolExp THEN
      # statements here
    ELSE
      # statements here
    ENDIF
  ENDIF

  ```
