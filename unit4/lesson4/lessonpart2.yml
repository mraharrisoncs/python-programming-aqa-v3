title: Using match/case
content: >
  ### Understanding match/case in Python


  The `match/case` statement is a type of **selection** statement that allows
  you to compare a value against a series of values or patterns and execute code
  based on which pattern matches.&#x20;


  ### Using match/case to replace if-elif-else chains:


  As we saw before, when you have a series of conditions that check the same
  variable, `match/case` can make your code cleaner and easier to read.


  ```python

  def get_day_name(day_number):
      match day_number:
          case 1:
              return "Monday"
          case 2:
              return "Tuesday"
          case 3:
              return "Wednesday"
          case 4:
              return "Thursday"
          case 5:
              return "Friday"
          case 6:
              return "Saturday"
          case 7:
              return "Sunday"
          case _:
              return "Invalid day"
  ```


  ### Handling Multiple Patterns:


  You can match multiple patterns in a single case using the `|` operator.


  ```python

  def is_weekend(day_number):
      match day_number:
          case 6 | 7:
              return True
          case _:
              return False
  ```


  Here, both 6 and 7 are matched in the same case, indicating the weekend days.

          What will be stored in the variable day if we run this code?
          day = get_day_name(2) 
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Tuesday
            explanation: The function returns "Tuesday" when the parameter is 2
