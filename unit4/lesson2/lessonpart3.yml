title: Using AND, OR and NOT
content: >
  The final Boolean operator you need to know is **not**. Unlike **and** and
  **or**, the **not** operator takes only one **operand**, and **inverts** it,
  changing True to False or False to True. Consider our party question again.
  This time Mum says "you can go to the party if you have **not** been given any
  detentions this term":


  ```python

  if not had_detentions:
      print("go to party")
  ```


  In the above code, **`had_detentions`** is a Boolean variable. But we can use
  any **Boolean expression** in our conditions, including arithmetic comparisons
  like > and !=. If we have an integer variable **`number_of_detentions`** then
  the code might look like this:


  ```python

  if number_of_detentions == 0:
      print("go to party")
  ```


  Dad has a word with Mum and relaxes the rule to "no more than two detentions,
  as long as you also wash the car, and don't argue with your brother". This
  would become:


  ```python

  if number_of_detentions == 0 and car_washed and not argued_with_brother:
      print("go to party")
  ```


  Notice that either side of every **and** statement, and following the
  **not** statement is a complete **Boolean expression**, either a Boolean
  variable (**`car_washed`**) or a comparison (**`number_of_detentions ==
  0`**).  


  ## Writing a Boolean function


  Let's look at one last example, and this time let's write a function that
  returns a Boolean value.&#x20;


  A ticket barrier will open when you tap your off-peak travelcard, if the card
  is valid, the balance on the card is at least £1.00 and the time of day is not
  before 9am. Write a function that returns True if the barrier should open, and
  False if not.


  ```python

  def check_smartcard(card_valid, card_balance, time_of_day_hh):
    if card_valid and card_balance >= 1.00 and not (time_of_day_hh <= 9)
      return True
    else:
      return False
  ```


  Notice there are sometimes several ways of writing conditions, we could
  write `time_of_day_hh > 9` instead, but `not (time_of_day_hh <= 9)` reflects
  the instructions given in the question more closely.


  ## Returning a Boolean directly


  In the above example, we don't actually need an if statement! The Boolean
  expression evaluates to True or False already, so we can just return that
  directly and achieve the same result:


  ```python

  def check_smartcard(card_valid, card_balance, time_of_day_hh):
    return card_valid and card_balance >= 1.00 and not (time_of_day_hh <= 9)
  ```


  The expression after `return` is evaluated, and the resulting value is
  returned from the function, which is exactly the same value as in the original
  `if-else` version!
