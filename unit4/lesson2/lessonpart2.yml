title: Using AND and OR
content: >
  Remember the party decision program?


  ```python

  if room_tidy == True and homework_done == True:
      print("go to party")
  ```


  The first thing to note is that `== True` is not needed in this code. That's
  because if an operand is already **Boolean**, we can use it directly in our
  expression. If the operand is already **True**, then the condition
  becomes `True == True`, which is also **True**, and if it's **False**, then
  `False == True` is also **False**! Let's simplify the code:


  ```python

  if room_tidy and homework_done:
      print("go to party")
  ```


  Remember this later when you are writing logical expressions with Boolean
  variables or Boolean expressions.&#x20;


  But back to the party, what if Dad relents and says "OK, you can go if you
  **either** tidy your room **or** do your homework today". That looks like
  this:


  ```python

  if room_tidy or homework_done:
      print("go to party")
  ```


  And let's change the pizza question to "Dan will buy pizza if he finishes work
  before 11 and either has more than five pounds in his pocket, **or** has
  remembered his debit card":


  ```python

  if finished_work < 11 and (cash_in_pocket > 5.0 or debit_card_in_pocket)
      print("buy pizza")
  ```


  We have used brackets above to ensure that Python evaluates the
  **or** operation first, then the **and** operation. This is important because
  the usual **order of operations **would perform **and** before **or,** but
  brackets are always evaluated first, just as in arithmetic operations
  (BIDMAS).

          What will be the result of this Boolean expression, if age = 18 and
          railcard = False?


          age \< 18 or railcard
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "True"
            explanation: No, 18 is not less than 18, and railcard is False
          - id: "2"
            value: "False"
            explanation: Correct, 18 \< 18 is False, and railcard is False so the expression
              evaluates to False
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "3"
            value: age
            explanation: No, Boolean expressions always evaluate to True or False
          - id: "4"
            value: railcard
            explanation: No, the result must be a Boolean value

          A program triggers a burglar alarm if either the door opens or the
          window opens. door_open and window_open are Boolean variables. Write
          the missing Boolean operator in this code:

            explanation: Yes, the answer is in the question! "if either the door opens or

          What is the output of this code, if finished_work = 10, cash_in_pocket

            explanation: Yes, 10 \< 11 is True, cash_in_pocket \> 5.0 is False but
              debit_card_in_pocket is True. True and (False or True) is True
          - id: "2"

            explanation: No, 10 \< 11 is True, cash_in_pocket \> 5.0 is False but
              debit_card_in_pocket is True. True and (False or True) is True
          - id: "3"
