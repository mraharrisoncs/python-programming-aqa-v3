title: Operator precedence
content: >+
  Just like in maths, Python has rules about which parts of a logical expression
  get evaluated first. These rules are called *operator precedence*. Like
  BIDMAS, Brackets are always evaluated first, then AND, OR and NOT, in that
  order. If you have arithmetic, comparisons **and** Boolean operations, then
  the full operator precedence rule is:


  | **Operator (high to low)** | **Examples**                        |

  | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |

  | **Brackets / Parentheses** | `(x + y)`, `(a > b and c)`          |

  | **Arithmetic operators**   | `**`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `+`, `-` |

  | **Comparison Operators**   | `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`    |

  | **NOT**                    | `not x`                             |

  | **AND**                    | `x and y`                           |

  | **OR**                     | `x or y`                            |


  You could use the acronym BACNAO or "Boole ate cheese, never ate olives"!
