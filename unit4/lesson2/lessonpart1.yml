  ## And operator


  Imagine you ask your parents if you can go to a party at the weekend. Your Dad
  says "yes, if you tidy your room **and** do your homework". We can use
  **and** in Python just like in English. The `if` statement would look like
  this:


  ```python

  if room_tidy == True and homework_done == True:
      print("go to party")
  ```


  Here's another example: "Dan will buy pizza if he finishes work before 11 and
  has more than five pounds in his pocket":


  ```python

  if finished_work < 11 and cash_in_pocket > 5.0:
      print("buy pizza")
  ```


  Notice how the Python `if` statement reads very much like English, it was
  designed that way to be easy to code! Just say the sentence in English, choose
  meaningful names for the variables and change words like "before" and "more
  than" to comparison operators ==, <, <=, >, >=, !=. That's it!


  ## Multiple 'and' operators


  We can have more than one logical operator in our conditions. We use Boolean
  logic a lot in games programming, here is an example from a text adventure
  game with two `and` operators:


  ```python

  has_key = True

  health_points = 119

  location = "outside_treasure_room"


  if has_key and health_points > 50 and location = "outside_treasure_room"
      print("You enter the treasure room!")
  ```


  Look at that if statement. If we read it out loud, we would say "If has key
  and health points greater than 50 and location equals outside treasure room
  door, print "You enter the treasure room!" This is basically an English
  description of the condition we need at this point in the game.&#x20;


  ## Try it


  Now you try writing a condition with `and` operators. Write the missing
  condition in the attached program. The function is designed to check test
  scores. The student will pass only if both score1 and score2 are more than 50.
  **Note**: just change line 8 and leave the rest alone.


  **Extension**: improve the program so that it only returns "pass" if both
  scores are over 50 **and** the total is at least 120.
