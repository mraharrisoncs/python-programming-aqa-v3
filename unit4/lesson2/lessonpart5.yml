title: Programming with AND, OR and NOT
content: >+
  ### Worked Example 1: Number checker


  Let's create a function that checks if a number is a **two-digit number that
  is divisible by either two or three**, for example 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20,
  21 .. 96, 98, 99.\*\* \*\*We'll use logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not`
  to achieve this.&#x20;


  Firstly let's work out some conditions we can use. **Having two digits** just
  means the number is between 10 and 99 inclusive. **Divisible by two** means
  that when we divide by two and take the **remainder**, this is **zero**.
  Likewise, **divisible by three** means when we divide by three the
  **remainder** is **zero**. We can use **MOD** or the Python operator **`%`**
  for this:


  ```python

  def check_number(num):
      # Check if the number is between 10 and 99, and divisible by 2 or 3
      if (num >= 10 and num <= 99) and (num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0):
          return "Yes"
      else:
          return "No"

  # main program  test the function

  print(check_number(12))  # Output: Yes

  print(check_number(15))  # Output: Yes

  print(check_number(25))  # Output: No

  print(check_number(99))  # Output: Yes

  ```


  ### Worked Example 2: String Slicing in a Word Game


  Let's play a word game. First pick a topic, e.g. "fruit". If I say **banana**,
  you must say a fruit that starts with the last letter of **banana**, so
  **avocado** is OK.  But another rule is you cannot say a word less than six
  letters long, so **apple** would not be allowed. The final rule is that
  **orange** is not allowed ever!


  Here is a function that uses Boolean logic with **and** to ensure the
  condition is met.


  ```python

  def is_valid_next_word(previous_word, next_word):
      # Check if the next word is valid
      if next_word[0] == previous_word[-1] and len(next_word) >= 6 and not next_word == "orange":
          return "Valid"
      else:
          return "Invalid"

  # main program - test the function

  print(is_valid_next_word("banana", "avocado"))      # Output: Valid

  print(is_valid_next_word("kumquat", "tamarind"))    # Output: Valid

  print(is_valid_next_word("banana", "loganberry"))   # Output: Invalid

  print(is_valid_next_word("banana", "apple"))        # Output: Invalid

  print(is_valid_next_word("avocado", "orange"))      # Output: Invalid





  ```
