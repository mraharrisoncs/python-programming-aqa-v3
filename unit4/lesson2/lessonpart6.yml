title: Python practical - AND, OR and NOT
content: >
  ## Using and, or, not


  ### 1. Enrolment checker


  Finish the function in **q1.py** to determine if a student can enrol in a
  course based on their age and exam results. The rules are as follows:


  * The student must be at least 18 years old.


  * One of their three exam grades must be an A.


  The function should take `age` as an integer, and `grades` as a string of
  three characters e.g. "AAB" or "BCC". Any one of these grades can be an A to
  enrol on the course. *Hint:* remember the **`in`** string operator.


  ### 2. Food safety advice


  In this exercise, you will complete a Python function to check if a person can
  eat a dish based on their allergies. Each person can state only two allergies,
  to make it simpler! The function will take three parameters:


  * A list of ingredients in a dish, stored in a single string, e.g. "milk,
  eggs, wheat, peanuts, sugar"


  * A string containing a single allergen, e.g. "peanuts"


  * Another string containing a single allergen, e.g. "shellfish"


  Complete the function in q2.py to print "Safe" if the dish does not contain
  the customer's allergens, otherwise print "Not safe".
