  ## Sequences


  Programs that use only sequences of operations are not very useful. Remember
  this program?


  ```python

  colour = input("What is your favourite colour?")

  print("I like", colour, "too!")

  ```


  But what if the computer's favourite colour is blue, and the user enters
  "red"? In this case we might want the program to say "Good choice, but I like
  blue best".


  ## Selection


  Here's how we do that:


  ```python

  colour = input("What is your favourite colour?")

  if colour == "blue":
    print("I like", colour, "too!")
  else:
    print("Good choice, but I like blue best")
  ```


  Python gives us the keywords `if` and `else` to control the **flow** of the
  program. In the above example, if the user enters "blue", the program will
  output "I like blue too!", if they enter anything else it will say "Good
  choice..."


  ## Try it out


  Before we dive deeper into how this works, try it for yourself. Open the
  attached program and...


  1. Predict what it does.

  2. Change the program so that instead of giving advice about the rain, if the
  input is "sunny" the program says "Wear sunscreen".

  3. Add another question, "Are you going to school? " and if the answer is
  "yes" then say "Remember your books", otherwise say "Have fun!".

          from 'weather' for the 3rd task? We should always use meaningful
          variables.
