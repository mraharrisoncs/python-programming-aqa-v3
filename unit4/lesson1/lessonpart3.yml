title: Boolean Expressions - comparing things
content: >
  ### Boolean Expressions in IF statements


  Remember, a Boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to either
  `True` or `False`. We use the result to control the flow of a program by using
  selection statements like `if` and `else`. We were looking at this example
  program:


  ```python

  weather = input("What is the weather today? ")

  if weather == "raining":
    print("Take an umbrella")
  else:
    print("Good to go!")
  ```


  The Boolean expression here is `weather == "raining"`, which always evaluates
  to either True or False, nothing else. We can use **any** Boolean expression
  as the condition on an `if` statement. Anything that evaluates to `True` or
  `False` can control an `if` statement.


  #### Comparison Operators


  In the above example, `==` is a **comparison operator** because it compare two
  values, in this case the contents of the variable `weather` and the string
  literal "raining". Putting two **operands** like this either side of a
  comparison operator makes a valid **Boolean expression,** which evaluates to a
  **Boolean value**: either `True` or `False`.&#x20;


  Here are the common comparison operators in Python:


  * `==`: Equal to


  * `!=`: Not equal to


  * `>`: Greater than


  * `>=`: Greater than or equal to


  * `<`: Less than


  * `<=`: Less than or equal to


  #### Writing a Boolean Expression


  A Boolean expression involves a comparison **operator** and two **operands,**
  one either side. Read through these examples and consider why we get the
  output shown:


  ```python

  >>> x = 10

  >>> y = 20


  >>> print(x == y)

  False


  >>> print(x != y)

  True


  >>> print(x > y)

  False


  >>> print(x <= y)

  True

  ```

          What are the operands in this Boolean expression?
          age \>= 18
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: age, 18
            explanation: Yes, the operands are the terms either side of the operator

          - id: "2"
            value: \>, =
            explanation: No, these are parts of the operator
          - id: "3"
            value: age, \>
            explanation: No, \> is part of the operator
          - id: "4"
            value: =, 18
            explanation: No, = is part of the operator

          Which comparison operator would be needed in an if statement to do the
          following?

          Check if a baby's weight is at least 3.5kg?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: \>=
            explanation: Yes, "at least" is a synonym for "greater than or equal to"
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: \<=
            explanation: No, this is "less than or equal to"?
          - id: "3"
            value: ==
            explanation: No, this is equals, or "exactly equal to"
          - id: "4"
            value: \>
            explanation: No, this is greater than, and we need a weight of exactly 3.5 to
              result in True.

          What does this Boolean expression evaluate to?
          "chalk" != "cheese"
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "True"
            explanation: Correct, "chalk" is not the same as "cheese"!
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "False"
            explanation: No, the != operator means "not equal to".
          - id: "3"
            value: chalk
            explanation: No, a Boolean expression always evaluates to either True or False
          - id: "4"
            value: cheese
            explanation: No, a Boolean expression always evaluates to either True or False
