  #### Using Boolean expressions in programs


  Boolean expressions are often used in `if-else` statements to decide which
  block of code should be executed. Here's another example that uses
  `>=` (greater than or equal to), and this time we have wrapped the code in a
  procedure definition:


  ```python

  def can_vote(age):
    if age >= 18:
      print("You are eligible to vote")
    else:
      print("You are not eligible to vote")

  # main program

  my_age = int(input("Age?"))

  print(can_vote(my_age))

  ```


  In this example, the Boolean expression `age >= 18` is evaluated. If it is
  `True`, the program prints "You are eligible to vote". Otherwise, it prints
  "You are not eligible to vote".&#x20;


  Here is another example, this time with a function that returns a string
  describing how someone is driving. I've also used a constant at the top of the
  code, so we can easily change the `speed_limit` later.


  ```python

  speed_limit = 30      


  def speed_check(current_speed):
    if current_speed <= speed_limit:
      return "Safe driving, keep going."
    else:
      return "Too fast, slow down!"

  # main program

  speed = int(input("Current speed?"))

  print(speed_check(speed))

  ```


  This time, the Boolean expression has two **variables** as the operands, and
  `less than or equal to` as the comparison operator  The
  expression `current_speed <= speed_limit` is evaluated. If `True`, the program
  outputs "Safe driving, keep going." Otherwise, it prints "Too fast, slow
  down!"


  ### Pseudocode notes


  Programming languages use combinations of basic symbols such as != and <=
  because these symbols are available in ASCII and can be entered directly on
  computer keyboards. In AQA exams, however, we use the standard mathematical
  symbols for comparison operators. Also we use the keywords IF, THEN, ELSE and
  ENDIF, and don't forget we use OUTPUT for print(), so the 'weather' example
  looks like this...


  ```python

  IF weather == "raining" THEN
    OUTPUT "Take an umbrella"
  ELSE
    OUTPUT "Good to go!"
  ENDIF

  ```


  ...the voting example like this...


  ```python

  IF age ≥ 18 THEN
    OUTPUT "You are eligible to vote"
  ELSE
    OUTPUT "You are not eligible to vote"
  ENDIF

  ```


  ...and the speed check example like this:


  ```python

  IF current_speed ≤ speed_limit THEN
    RETURN "Safe driving, keep going."
  ELSE
    RETURN "Too fast, slow down!"
  ENDIF

  ```

          What is the output of this code?
          pension_age = 67
          age = 67
          if age \>= pension_age:
              print("State pension due")
          else:
              print("Not yet!")
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: State pension due
            explanation: Yes, 67 \>= 67 evaluates to True
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: Not yet
            explanation: No, 67 \>= 67 evaluates to True
          - id: "3"
            value: "67"
            explanation: No, the output is one of the strings
          - id: "4"
            value: Syntax Error
            explanation: No, the code is syntactically correct

        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: "if temperature \\>= 21:"
            explanation: Yes, the ≥ symbol must be written as \>=
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: "if temperature \\<= 21:"
            explanation: No, the ≥ symbol is not \<=
          - id: "3"
            value: if temperature \>= 21
            explanation: You need a punctuation mark in Python to indicate that an indented
              code block follows
          - id: "4"
            value: "if temperature != 21:"
            explanation: No, the ≥ symbol means greater than or equal to, != means not equal
